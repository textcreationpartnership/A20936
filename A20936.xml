            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost Excellent Prince, I lay at your Highnes feet this <hi>Buckler</hi> of the faith, wherein the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats and conflicts of error and truth are liuely set forth: Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly beseeching your Highnesse, that as I haue made it for the defence of that cause which your Highnesse maintaineth: so it may be vpheld by your Princely authoritie. Your vertue which exceeds your yeares maketh you a fit Iudge of these matters; and your princely affabilitie (whereof I haue had experience) encourageth me to haue accesse vnto you. Besides, I could not better adorne &amp; beautifie the frontispice of this my work, then by prefixing to it the name of so great a Prince:
<pb facs="tcp:11462:3"/> who being now nursed by the Church, shall one day be a nursing Father thereof: who hauing sucked Pietie from his mothers breasts, and following the steps of his Royall father to frame himselfe to vertue, hath no need of any other examples then do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticall: Being the sonne of a great Prince, whose actions are rules, and his words wise instructions: Whose zeale not being confined within the limits of his owne Kingdomes, produceth noble effects in forreine countries. From whose mouth (most noble Prince) you haue learned, how difficult a matter it is to Command: How he whom God bath fauoured and aduanced aboue all, hath so much the greater account to render vnto him: How it is a thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy double commendation in a Prince, to obey the wil of God, because he hath more means to fulfill his owne: How hard a thing it is to procure to so many persons rest by his trauell, and secure repose by his vigilancie: How necessarie it is for him, to haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him vertuous persons, whose eyes and eares he may make vse of, lest peraduenture otherwise he come last to know the truth: How carefully he ought to guide his actions, sith they are exposed to the view of so many millions, and subiect to euery ones construction: How his Wisedome ought to be armed with Courage, because a vertuous Prince must make
<pb facs="tcp:11462:3"/> account to haue the diuell his enemie. These holy Instructions (most noble Prince) which are familiar vnto you together with the gifts of nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God hath abundantlie adorned you, call you to great matters, and promise great effects, and fill with great hopes the hearts of all those that feare God: Who esteeme you as a plant which God hath planted, which he dresseth with his owne hand, which he watereth with his grace, and will one day make fructifie to his glorie. For my part sith I can ad nothing to your praise, I will offer my vowes to God for your prosperitie: hoping that your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse will fauourably accept of my affection, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme me to be your Highnesse</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THOSE OF THE CHVRCH OF ROME.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>IRS, that which I intend at this time to offer vnto you, it may be, would be better accepted if it were tendred vnto you by another hand: howbeit I dare boldly affirme, that neuer any spake vnto you, that was either more voide of hatred, of more desirous of your good and saluation. The word of God, whereupon we ground our Religion, commandeth vs to loue those that hate vs; and to beleeue that those which haue persecuted vs, haue thought that in so do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they haue done God good seruice. Euery man that seeketh the truth, ought to be thus affected, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it is impossible to reape any fruite by our communication: for no wound will euer be healed, as long as the inflammatiō continues. And as in an house that burneth, those that speake are not vnderstood, by reason of the noise and cries of those that gather about it: so we shall neuer vnderstand one the other, as long as our minds are inflamed with hatred and rancour. The studie of sacred truth requireth a peaceable spirit, which deliberately weigheth things, without carping at the persons. For what reason haue we to hate any man because he erreth, or because we thinke we see clearer then he doth? Now as blind men commonly
<pb facs="tcp:11462:4"/> are mutinous and cholericke, so those men are most violent that haue least vnderstanding: so that he that will take vpon him to remedy this ignorance, must seeke to pacifie their rage. But there is no hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in him who studieth to be ignorant, and feareth to know the will of God, lest he should be obliged to follow it. Such is the malady of this age, wherein the people make profession to follow without knowledge; and to beleeue the Church, not knowing what the Church ought to beleeue: and rely vpon the faith of another, not knowing the rule of faith, which is the word of God. As if those that are our pastors and guides, ought to be our warrant before the iugdement seate of God; or as if it were a vertue to beleeue in God by an atturney. It is true, that the people ought to obey their guides (prouided God be their guide,) and to beleeue that which they teach, (so that which they teach be drawne from the word of God:) which if they hide from the people, and hinder them from the reading thereof, it is an euident signe either that they feele themselues culpable; or that in stead of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting themselues vnto this rule, they would haue their authority to be the supreme rule. For why should the word of God contained in the holy Scriptures, be suspected by vs to be a dangerous booke?<note place="margin">Index librorū prohibitorum cum regulis confectis per patres à Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentina Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do delectos.

               </note> Why should children be forbidden to looke into their fathers testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle wrote his Epistles to the people of Rome, Corinth, and Ephesus, that they might reade them: why then should Christians in
<pb facs="tcp:11462:5"/> these dayes be depriued of the reading of them? The Catholicke Epistles of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> are written to all the faithfull in generall: why then should not Christian people reade those let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are expresly addressed vnto them, and written for their instructions? Why should not a Christian reade the writings of the Prophets, as well as they of Beroea did,<note place="margin">Act. 17.11.</note> who hauing bin at Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching, went and conferred his doctrine with the Scriptures? To what end is it, in our Sermons to alledge the places of the holy Scriptures, if the auditory be not permitted to examine whether they haue bin faithfully and truly alledged? It is a most horrible thing, that in those countries where the Inquisition reigneth, it should be a crime deseruing burning, to haue a Bible in the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar tongue; and in the meane time not onely the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of friuolous fables is tollerated, but whoredome also by the law and publicke authoritie is established and permitted. And if it be the translation that displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his Holinesse, at least he ought to take order that there should be one done according to his mind. To alledge that some men abuse the reading thereof, is as much as to accuse the Apostles of want of discretion, for hauing written their Epistles to Christian people, without foreseeing that they might abuse them. By the same reason also, preaching likewise should be prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, because men abuse it. We also abuse the bountie and goodnesse of God. And if we must haue speciall leaue to reade the holy Scriptures, is it not a miserable case, that we may not obey God without licence? and that God can haue no seruants without the Pope of Romes permission? If they say, that it is not conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nor fit that ignorant people should reade them; I
<pb facs="tcp:11462:5"/> answer, that all men are ignorant in religion before they haue read them; and that, without impietie, a man cannot haue knowledge in religion without the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Therefore let me intreate you to shake off this scrupulositie, whereby God is wronged, as if his word were contagious, and a net spread abroad to intangle the consciences of weake Christians; lest that prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie be accomplished in you which is pronounced by the Prophet <hi>Esay,</hi> saying,<note place="margin">Esa. 5.13.</note>
               <hi>Therefore my people are gone into captiuitie because they haue no knowledge;</hi> and that saying of our Sauiour Christ, <hi>Ye are deceiued,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 22.19.</note>
               <hi>not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures.</hi> Suffer not this precious treasure, nor this contract of our spirituall mariage with the Sonne of God, to be pulled out of your hands. Suspect those who during the night of ignorance, hide this celestiall light, and in the meane time light and set vp candles at noone day. Neuer hope to be saued by the faith of other men, for God saith,<note place="margin">Habac. 2.4.</note> that <hi>The iust shall liue by his faith;</hi> and that <hi>If the blind leade the blind,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 15.14.</note>
               <hi>both shall fall into the ditch.</hi> Now to make you know, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is taken away from you, not to keepe you within the bounds of sobrietie, but to detaine you in igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, consider that in the Church of Rome they reade certaine Chapters of the holy Scriptures openly vnto you in a language which you vnderstand not. If in those Chapters men spake vnto God, it might for an excuse be alledged, that God vnderstandeth all langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: but those Chapters are diuine instructions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God speaketh vnto men. Tell me in conscience, why should God be, as it were, a barbarian vnto vs, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king vnto vs in an vnknowne tongue? Why doth he speake vnto men, but because he would haue them to vnderstand him? Why are those things (which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb facs="tcp:11462:6"/> would be held to be ridiculous, and contrary to common sense) in religion esteemed to be good and conuenient? Is it not rather an intention of the enemy of our saluation, by that meanes to expose Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to an open scorne, and to hinder the word of God from being vnderstood by vs? to the end also that the threatning pronounced by God vnto those people with whom he is angry, might be accomplished, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.21.</note>
               <hi>By men of other languages will I speake vnto this people, and yet will they not heare me.</hi> This mischiefe hath produced another; for that by taking the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures from you, which is the booke that maketh men wise, they haue giuen you images, which are termed the books of the ignorant, because by them ignorance is maintained. By them the people is amused, in stead of being taught the truth. In stead of instruction, they giue them recreation. But because the second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of the law of God is against it, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the seruice of God, forbiddeth vs to make any grauen images, &amp; to worship or fall downe before any thing that is in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath: and that this law pronounced with thunder and lighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, thundereth yet against this superstition: these Doctors haue imposed silence to the law of God, and haue bene so bold as to race this commandement out of the Houres of the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> and Seruice bookes which they giue you leaue to reade: which makes vs wholly to suspect them. And it is a thing hardly to be thought or beleeued, that poore little wormes of the earth dare be so bold, as to correct that law which God pronounced with his owne mouth: yea the same law, whereby at the latter day they shall be iudged. For these practises the holy and sacred name of the Church
<pb facs="tcp:11462:6"/> serueth for a couer. They say, that the Church cannot erre: that she is the soueraigne Iudge of the points and doubts of faith: and that she is an infallible interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Scriptures. By which Church they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand neither the Grecian, Syrian, nor African, (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though much ancienter and purer then the Romane,) but onely the Romane Church: which hauing neuer bene other then a particular Church, is said to be the vniuersall Church; and by this meanes the Church of Rome is become a iudge in her owne cause. The Greek Church (much ancienter then the Romane) complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that the Church of Rome hath reuolted and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated it selfe from her, producing against her, her chaires, her succession, and her antiquitie. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie, the Church of Rome boasteth to be Iudge, and so will be both Iudge and partie. And in the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, whether the Church of Rome cannot erre, she her selfe will be Iudge: and which is more, when que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion is made to decide what the dutie of the Church is, the Church of Rome will be the soueraigne Iudge, that she may haue no other law then that which she will establish, and which she propoundeth to her selfe. And when any argument is moued concerning the sense and interpretation of the Law of God, she saith she is the infallible interpreter thereof, and will haue her interpretations to be held to be of equall authority with the Law of God. And yet it is certaine, that at the latter day she shall be iudged by that Law. There is no absurditie more palpable, then to make sinfull men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible iudges of the sence of that law by which their sins ought to be iudged. What obedience, thinke you, is the soueraigne Maister of all creatures to expect, if his seruants might presume to say vnto him, It is true
<pb facs="tcp:11462:7"/> that thou hast commanded vs to obserue such a law, but we interprete the same otherwise, and iudge that thy commandement ought thus to be vnderstood; and thou knowest that we are infallible iudges in such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that our interpretations are of equall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie with thy commandement. After this maner it were better to be a seruant then a maister. By which of these two wayes, think you, ought the Prelates of the Church to be iudged at the latter day? whether by the law of God, or by their owne interpretations? Herein I make all men iudges, that haue any sparke of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, or any free iudgement without preiudicate opinion in them; whether in religion, God gouerning and teaching the Church by his word, or the Church which ought to receiue this word and yeeld obedience vnto him, ought rather to be soueraigne Iudge? And which should rather be Iudge, either the Scripture that commands that there shall be a Church, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds and prescribes lawes thereunto; or the Church which onely testifieth the same to be the Scripture? specially seeing that this testimonie may be giuen by a corrupt and disobedient Church to the Scripture? Which shall rather be Iudge, the Scripture that is one, and which iudgeth without passion; or the Church which is deuided into diuers contrary Churches, which cannot be assembled together, and whereof the Pastors are subiect to be ambitious, and addicted to couetous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and that ought to be suspected Iudges, when they onely seeke their owne profite and authoritie.</p>
            <p>Here I can easily, as it were with a finger, point out and shew vnto you, that you are led and guided in a way wherein it is impossible for you to be saued. For you are taught simply to beleeue in the Church of
<pb facs="tcp:11462:7"/> Rome, and without other enquiry, wholly to depend vpon the authoritie thereof. And yet neuerthelesse, you are depriued of all meanes whereby to know and find out, whether this Church wherein you beleeue is pure, and teacheth true doctrine. For how should you know it? is it by the holy Scriptures? But that booke you are not permitted to reade. At Rome and in Spaine, to reade it is burning. Wil you know it by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie? But they are Greeke and Latin bookes, which the people vnderstand not. What knowes an artificer, a woman, or labourer among you, whether his Church teacheth truly according to the Scriptures? or whether his Church was the same that it is now, twelue or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred yeares past? or whether in a great role of Popes set downe in a paper, the first of them belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued as the latter do; and whether time hath wrought no alteration therein? To be short, you haue no other proofe for the puritie of your Church, but onely the testimonie of your Church it selfe, the Prelates where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of boast and brag that they cannot erre. In the meane time they bereaue you of all meanes of discerning er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror from truth, by hiding from you the rule of truth, which is the holy Scriptures. But why should the Church of Rome rather haue this perfection, then the Greeke or Syrian Churches (farre ancienter and purer then the Church of Rome) founded by Iesus Christ himselfe and by his Apostles, and which also affirme that they haue Saint <hi>Peters</hi> chaire? Doth the Scripture attribute any prerogatiue aboue others to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church? or doth it giue her the priuiledge not to erre? From all this there followeth two things that are as cleare as the Sunne at noone day; the one, that your faith is onely grounded vpon the authoritie of
<pb facs="tcp:11462:8"/> men; and by consequence, that your religion is hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, and not diuine. Whosoeuer saith, I beleeue the Gospell and the word of God, because the Church commandeth it, giueth more credite to the Church then to God. To doubt of Gods truth, is a lesse crime then to make it to depend vpon men. The other, that of all humane testimonies you ground vpon the worst &amp; most vncertaine: for you beleeue that your Church is good, because she saith so, and make her Iudge in her owne cause: not once considering, that by this word Church, you vnderstand not the Christian people, nor all Pastors in generall, but the Pope and a few Prelats, whose rules are called the Rules of the Church; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they tend wholly to the profite of the Clergie, and to aduance the Empire of the Bishop of Rome. And will you alwayes hold your soules, by God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted according to his image, and which he hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the bloud of his Sonne, in this miserable cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuitie? Will you draw and heape the wrath and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of God vpon your heads, by reiecting the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation which is offered vnto you?</p>
            <p>I confesse that the Church of Rome in certaine points alledgeth the Scriptures; and that betweene vs and her there is great contention touching the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation thereof: but we vse the Scriptures in other manner then those that teach you.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For they prohibite the people to reade them, and we exhort them thereunto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They perswade you that the Scriptures are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and ambiguous: but we say, that all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to saluation are therein contained, and may be from thence clearely deduced.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They say, that the Scriptures are an imperfect
<pb facs="tcp:11462:8"/> rule, and will haue another vnwritten rule, and tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Church, which they equall in authoritie with the Scriptures. We on the contrary say, that the holy Scriptures are able to make vs wise vnto saluation:<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.15. 1. Cor. 4.6.</note> and that we ought not to presume aboue that which is written: and that in those things which are cleare and manifest in the Scriptures, and need no interpretation, all doctrines necessary to saluation are contained.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Also when we alledge the Scriptures, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them as the soueraigne Iudge, and as that which gouerneth the Church, and giues her her authoritie. But the Church of Rome alledgeth the Scriptures as a doctrine authorised by the Church, and saith, that we must receiue them because the Church hath so ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And when we interpret the Scriptures, we giue not our interpretations for lawes, as the Church of Rome doth, neither do we make our selues iudges and infallible interpreters of the holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Lastly, when we interpret the Scriptures, we draw our interpretations from the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. But the Church of Rome drawes her interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from the vnwritten word and traditions.<note place="margin">He tooke bread &amp; gaue it, Do this in remembrance of me.</note> As for example, we expound these words, <hi>This is my bodie,</hi> by these words, <hi>The bread which I giue you, is the commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of my bodie;</hi> which exposition is found in the text it selfe, touching the institution of the Sacrament: or by these words of the Apostle,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.16.</note>
               <hi>The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the bodie of Christ?</hi> But your Doctors do not interpret the Scriptures so: for they draw their interpretations from the vnwritten word, and from Traditions. When the Lord said to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I haue prayed that thy faith may not faile:</hi> they say
<pb facs="tcp:11462:9"/> that by those words the vertue not to erre was promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and to the Popes of Rome his suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors. But the Scripture speaketh not of Popes, nor of Bishops of Rome, nor giueth any successor to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his Apostolicall place. In like sort there is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in <hi>Malachi</hi> of a pure oblation that should be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in all places.<note place="margin">Mala. 1.11.</note> This oblation, according to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of the Romish Doctors, is the Masse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they say, that the body of our Lord is really sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. But this interpretation is taken out of the vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word: for the holy Scripture speaketh not of the Masse, neither commandeth vs to sacrifice the body of Iesus Christ; nor establisheth Priests in the Church to sacrifice the Sonne of God. And so when the Scripture saith, <hi>Thou shalt worship one onely God, and him onely shalt thou serue:</hi> the Romish Doctors interpret it, that God onely forbiddeth the adoration of <hi>Latria,</hi> but not of <hi>Dulia,</hi> which is an inferiour religious seruice. But the Scriptures make no mention of the adoration of <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> nor of any other religious seruice, but onely of that which is due vnto God. These are interpretations which the Romish Church drawes from the vnwritten word, which is referred to the discretion of the Church of Rome, and cannot be learned but from her mouth. For I am of opinion, that neuer any man saw all the doctrines of the vnwritten word drawne into one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, because that word altereth and changeth with times and seasons, and is accommodated to the times, and that still the Church of Rome hath power to adde new articles therunto, and namely touching the points of faith.</p>
            <p>The greatest mischiefe is, that these traditions and doctrines of the vnwritten word, are not onely addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:11462:9"/> to the Scriptures, but manifest contradictions: whereof the Masse onely sheweth many examples.</p>
            <p n="1">1.<note place="margin">Bellar. in Bark cap. <hi>3.</hi> Non re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte de Ecclesia Christi sentit, qui nihil ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittit, nisi quod expresse in veteri Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum aut factū esse legit: quasi Ecclesia poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioris temporis aut defierit esse Ecclesia, aut facultatem non habeat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicandi, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarandi, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituendi, etiā &amp; iubendi quae ad fidem &amp; mores Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.</note> For Iesus Christ administring the Sacrament of the Eucharist, spake in a tongue vnderstood by the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistants: but the Priest in the Masse speakes in a tongue not vnderstood by the people.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Iesus Christ communicated to all the assistants: but the Priest oftentimes eateth and drinketh alone.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Iesus Christ giueth the cup to all men, and will haue all to drinke thereof: but the Priest drinkes alone, and denieth the cup to the people.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Iesus Christ offered nothing to God: but the Priest in the Masse prayeth God to accept his oblation of Christ.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Iesus Christ lifted vp no hoast: but the Priest lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vp an hoast to be adored.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In the institution of the holy Sacrament, there is no mention made of a sacrifice, nor to sacrifice the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of Iesus Christ: on the contrary, the Priest preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to sacrifice the body of Iesus Christ in a reall and propitiatory sacrifice for the quicke and the dead.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the institution of this Sacrament, there is no adoration of the hoast, but all the Apostles sate at the table: on the contrary, the Priest causeth the hoast to be adored. He that at this day should do as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles did, should be held and esteemed to be prophane and an hereticke.<note place="margin">Oramus te Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine per meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Sanctorum quorum reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiae hic sunt &amp; omnium Sanctorum, vt indulgere dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neris omnia peccata mea.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. There was no reliques hidden vnder the Lords table, nor bones of any of the Patriarkes or Prophets: on the contrary, vnder the stones of the altar there are bones of the dead, without which reliques an altar can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be consecrated; and the Priest in the Masse asketh mercie and forgiuenesse of his sinnes for the merites
<pb facs="tcp:11462:10"/> of the Saints, whose bones are hidden vnder the altar.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Gospell witnesseth, that Iesus Christ giuing bread vnto his disciples, said, it was his body: on the contrary, the Priest saith, that the bread is not the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Iesus Christ, but that the bread is transsubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into the body of Iesus Christ.</p>
            <p n="10">11. Iesus Christ witnesseth, that it was the fruite of the vine which he dranke: but the Priest denieth that it is the fruite of the vine.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Iesus Christ will haue vs to do it in remembrance of him: but the Priest pretendeth to make Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in foure places saith, that we breake and eate bread: on the contrary, the Priest maintaineth that we neither breake nor eate bread.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The Lord instituted a Sacrament, but the Priest celebrateth a sacrifice. In a word, the one celebrated the holy Supper, the other singeth Masse, expresly made to disfigure the holy Supper of the Lord.</p>
            <p>The Romish Doctors thinke to defend their cause by vsing a childish accusation or obiection against vs, saying, that seeing we will needs follow our Lord Iesus Christ, we ought to celebrate the holy Sacrament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter supper, in a high chamber, and admit no women vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. But neither the place, nor the houre, nor the sexes of the assistants, are of the essence or any part of the action; and without them the action is still entire: and therein Iesus Christ neither prescribed any rule, nor made any prohibition. But the change and alteration which we obiect against them, is in essentiall things, and such as change the nature of the action: seeing that thereby an adoration is induced, which was neuer com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, nor yet practised by the Apostles: a sacrifice
<pb facs="tcp:11462:10"/> established which the Lord did not appoint: a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition touching dead mens bones authorized: a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon repast changed into a priuate Masse: and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple depriued of the vnderstanding of the ordinary Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice; taught to take God in their hands, to eate their Creator, to adore the Creature, and are depriued of halfe the Sacrament (that is, of the cup) whereof Christ said, <hi>Drinke ye all of this;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.8. Let a man examine him selfe, and so eate of this bread and drinke of this cup.</note> as the Apostle also comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the people of Corinth to take the cup as well as the bread. Wherein we propound a way and meanes for vs to agree one with another, which cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused but by him that loueth discord, that hath no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian bloud in him, or that striueth against God. For euery Christian confesseth, that Iesus Christ did well, and that there is no exception to be taken against his institution. And although it were lawfull to celebrate the Supper in other manner then he did it, yet all men grant, that it should not be ill done to follow his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to speake as he spake, and to do as he did. This is it that we require. And it is certaine, that the Pope might end all the controuersies growne and raised vpon this point, which trouble and make a diuision in Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if he would reduce the holy Supper into the forme wherein the Lord did celebrate it; laying aside all disputations, and bind the people to the example of the Sonne of God. What discommodities or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences soeuer might be alledged to the contrary, they cannot equalize nor counterballance the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that we owe vnto Iesus Christ, the peace of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome, nor the revnion of this rupture and separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people, which hath bin the cause of so many troubles, and hath shed so much bloud, and which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the sides of the Church of Rome, as well as it doth
<pb facs="tcp:11462:11"/> ours, exposing the same to the violence of Turkes and Infidels.</p>
            <p>All indifferent persons will easily confesse and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that this is truth; but fearing that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences should be touched therewith, they vse an arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall meanes to represent our religion vnto you in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maner then it is, and paint it out before you like a terrible monster, making vs to speake and teach those things which are altogether contrary to our beleefe and confession: and withall, diuers of you are so light of credit, and so easily caried away, that you rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to learne and vnderstand what our religion is by the inuectiues of our enemies, then by our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession. And although we haue protested, that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue nothing of all that which they impose vpon vs, yet they will constantly perswade vs, that we beleeue that which we beleue not. Wherein against their wils they iustifie vs. For thereby they secretly confesse, that our religion being truly set downe, cannot be repressed: and that if it were liuely described, it would at the first make a strong impression in the spirits and hearts of the auditors, by the euidence of the truth thereof. They say,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our religion teacheth, that good works are not necessary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the elect may commit sinne, and liue wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly without danger.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That God rewardeth not good workes.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That God constraineth our wils, and forcibly draweth them to goodnesse.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That we accuse and blame God to be vniust, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing propounded a law vnto vs, which we cannot fulfil.</p>
            <p n="6">6. That we are enemies to the Saints and to the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Marie.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:11462:11"/>
            <p n="7">7. That to vnderstand the Scriptures, euery one of vs boasteth that we haue a particular inspiration giuen vnto vs.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And that we deny the omnipotent power of God in the Eucharist. All this is false, and contrary to our beleefe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our religion teacheth, that good workes are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to saluation. For men go not into heauen by the way of hell, nor to the kingdome of God by seruing the diuell.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Our religion teacheth, that those that are prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated to saluation, are also predestinated to liue holy. To say, I may boldly liue wickedly because I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destinated to saluation, is the speech of a reprobate, that will be wicked because God is good, and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Gods grace (which is a prouocation and a goade to prick vs forward to vertue) a pillow to lull him asleep in vice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our religion beleeueth, that God rewardeth good works, but of his free mercie, without desert.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It beleeueth that God constraineth not mens wils, but boweth them, and causeth them willingly to addict their minds to goodnesse.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It doth not esteeme it a thing vniust, that God requireth that of man which he cannot do, when man is bound to do it, and that his weaknes or want of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie proceedeth from himselfe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It honoureth the Saints, as the same Saints did honour those Saints that were before them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. For the vnderstanding of the Scriptures, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth it selfe with that which therein is clearely and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently set downe, and leaueth particular inspirations to mad and fantasticall persons.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:11462:12"/>
            <p n="8">8. It denieth not the omnipotent power of God in the Eucharist, but it ruleth it selfe according to his will. It vseth the holy Sacrament, not to make Iesus Christ, but to honour him; not to make his body to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend downe vnto vs, but to eleuate and lift vp our hearts vnto him. It taketh not vpon her to take God in this life, but is content that God would be pleased to take vs vp into heauen when we die. She is not afraid that God can fall, be stolen, caried away by a mouse, or eaten by his enemies. She beleeueth not that the Son of God and the diuell both entred into <hi>Iudas</hi> together at one time; nor that Iesus Christ did eate himselfe, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was not necessary for our redemption.</p>
            <p>Our religion is a religion that acknowledgeth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther head of the Church but Iesus Christ, no other rule of faith then his word, no propitiatory sacrifice but his death, no other purgatory but his bloud, nor other merits but his obedience.</p>
            <p>It is a religion that will haue the people to reade the word of God, because she is not afraid that men therin shall find their condemnation; which speaketh in a knowne language, because she is not ashamed of her beleefe.</p>
            <p>It is a religion which teacheth fasting to consist in abstinence from meate, and not in distinction of meates: she fasteth for exercise of humilitie, and not with opinion of merite or satisfaction: she borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not other mens satisfactions, but with the Apostle beleeueth,<note place="margin">Gal. 6.5.</note> that euery man shall beare his own burthen.</p>
            <p>It is a religion, which distrusting in her owne works, trusteth in the promises of God; which preacheth hope and affiance, and not to doubt of her saluation: which recommendeth an humble assurance, and not an arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
<pb facs="tcp:11462:12"/> perplexitie, by the which those that display or boast of their owne merits, make profession to doubt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their saluation.</p>
            <p>It is a religion, wherein men confesse &amp; acknowledge that they haue often done that which God forbiddeth to be done; far from hauing done more then he cōman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to be done: and is so far frō doing superabundant works, that it faileth in doing that which is necessary to be done. It pretendeth not to make God debtor to man by works of supererogation, but confesseth man to be a sinner before God, because of his disobedience.</p>
            <p>It is a religion, which in stead of framing and fashio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning stones like vnto the image of man, seeketh by all meanes possible to reforme man according to the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God. In stead of worshipping a crosse of wood, adoreth Christ crucified, trusteth in his passion, and glorieth in his ignominie.</p>
            <p>It is a religion which beleeueth not, that God which gaue his Sonne to die to saue his enemies, taketh plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to torment the soules of his children in a fire of Purgatory, and to punish them for sinnes already par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned (and for the which Iesus Christ hath made full satisfaction) by punishments which serue not to amend the sinner, but to satisfie the iustice of God.</p>
            <p>It is a religion which maketh not her prayers by number, neither maketh the efficacie of prayer to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist in the often repetition of the same prayer, but in faith and the disposition of the heart.</p>
            <p>It is a religion which holdeth that faith consisteth not in ignorance, but in knowledge: which equally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministreth holy things as well to the rich as to the poore; not as in the Romish Church, where dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and absolutions are sold, and particular Masses
<pb facs="tcp:11462:13"/> are neuer said, but for them that first giue something to the Priest.</p>
            <p>To be short, it is a religion which hath litle outward shew and glory, but much inward comfort, constancy and perseuerance, which will be knowne by the effects; and ordaineth few ceremonies, but ministreth many instructions.</p>
            <p>You make answer to this, and say, that these are new things. How esteeme you them to be new, seeing that Iesus Christ himselfe &amp; his Apostles taught in that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? It is true, that they are new to those that are nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished in an inueterate error. Healing is newer then the disease: but we must alwayes ascend vp to the spring of truth, in regard whereof all old errors are new. No man euer opposed himselfe against an accustomed rooted error, but he was accused of noueltie. But this reproch of noueltie, ill becometh the mouthes of those persons which hide the true antiquitie from the people (that is, the word of God,) and which maintaine, that yet at this day the Church may &amp; can make new ordinances tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching faith; and which by the Church vnderstand no other then the Romish Church; that in the first ages after the Apostles, cannot produce one man that was of their religion; and which know that in all antiquitie there is no mention made of excluding the people frō the cup, of prohibiting them the reading of the holy Scriptures, of reading the Scriptures to the people in an vnknowne tongue which they vnderstand not, of pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Trinitie, of worshipping images, of adoring the hoast with the worship of <hi>Latria,</hi> of priuate Masses, of the Bishop of Romes Court, of his Indulgences, of the treasure of the church, of his power to depose kings, and of drawing soules out of Purgatory, nor of many
<pb facs="tcp:11462:13"/> other corruptions which are beautified and set forth with the fraudulent title of Apostolicall traditions, as if they came from the Apostles themselues.</p>
            <p>Those that boast &amp; brag of Antiquitie, are they that rudely handle the Doctors, and censure and condemne them at their pleasure; that will haue the Fathers to be interpreters of the Scriptures (so that they themselues may be interpreters of the Fathers,<note place="margin">Cotton in the Preface of his Cath. Institut. speaketh thus of those two vniuersall Councels, saying, Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia began <hi>an.</hi> 380. to draw on to rebelliō against the holy seate, &amp; to tranerse the authoritie of the Bishop of Rome, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing the Bishop of Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople to be his equall. After that, <hi>an.</hi> 450. they said, that they had the same priuiledges.</note> and iudges of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie,) and that not onely condemne euery particular Father, but also whole Councels, wherein the Fathers generally spake all together. Three vniuersall Councels condemned <hi>Honorius</hi> Bishop of Rome to be an heretik, but at this day they reiect those Councels. At the first Councell of Constantinople, <hi>anno</hi> 381. there was 150 orthodoxe Bishops, and 630 at the Councell of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon holden <hi>an.</hi> 451. and yet neither that great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, nor the great antiquitie, hindreth our aduersaries from condemning all those Fathers for making the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Constātinople equal with the Bishop of Rome in Ecclesiasticall things. The Councell of Constance holden <hi>anno</hi> 1416. acknowledgeth that in the primitiue Church the faithfull receiued the Sacrament vnder both kinds, and neuerthelesse ordaineth that those that would follow the ancient custome, should be holden and esteemed to be hereticks, and grieuously punished.</p>
            <p>And it is a wonder how these men dare speake of Councels, when they know very well, that day is not more contrary to night, then ancient Councels are cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the new, wherein the Pope ruleth all, and ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all, the other Bishops onely giuing their consents, by bowing their heads in signe of approbation; when at the entring into the same Councels, the holy Bible is laid at the Popes feet, to witnes that the word of God
<pb facs="tcp:11462:14"/> is subiect vnto him; where the Pope is set in an high throne, &amp; the Emperour below at his feet. To be short, we see, by the practises of the latter Councels, specially the Councell of Florence, the last of Latran, and by the booke of sacred Ceremonies, that a Councell for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ages past, is nothing else but a Papall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistory, but held with more solemnitie: whereas in the ancient Councels, the Bishop of Rome durst not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally appeare, and his ordinary Deputies therein had neither presidence nor authoritie: which is far from or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, <hi>that no booke shall be Canonicall without the Popes authoritie;</hi> and that <hi>all Kings must kisse his feete:</hi> and to declare,<note place="margin">Annal. Baron. an. <hi>1076.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>there is no other name vnder the heauens, but that of the Pope:</hi> which are the decrees &amp; ordinances of the Councell of Rome vnder <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7. <hi>an.</hi> 1076.</p>
            <p>To conclude, it is most certaine, that those which sound in your eares the Fathers and the Councels, do it not because the ancient Fathers are any thing fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable vnto them, but because they know, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people cannot tell how to disproue them, and that in those things you must of necessitie refer your selues vnto them. But touching the Scriptures, which you may and ought to know, and which rule all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, those you are forbidden to reade. Yeares are not rules, and lying was from the beginning of the world. And if custome may serue for a law, tell me how many yeares at the least are required to authorise a doctrine? The Church is not in a country gouerned by custome, but in a country gouerned by a written law. There is no prescription against the diuine truth. In the time of the Apostles this mystery of iniquitie began to be hatched. How much then, thinke you, is it now increased? And in truth both the people and the pastors of the Church
<pb facs="tcp:11462:14"/> of Rome crie out since certaine yeares past, that the Church hath need to be reformed. At the Councell of Pisa, <hi>an.</hi> 1411. Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the fift, in the 20 Session, solemnly promised to spend some time to take order for the reformation of the Church, and to that end to assemble the wisest men of all nations. Not long after that, there was a Councell helden at Senes, <hi>anno</hi> 1423. where the proposition of the reformatiō of the church was laid vpon the table, and after referred to another time; for they saw that they could not stirre that stone, without shaking the Papall dignitie.</p>
            <p>But that which great personages would not do, God hath done it by meaner men, vsing vnexpected and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoped for meanes, to set the doctrine of saluation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the peoples eyes, in despite of all the forces that Satan could vse against it. You are bound and behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto those that haue taken paines and trauelled in this worke, for this, that the holy Scripture (which the people saw not) is now translated into our mother tongue; and that the Spirit of God speaketh French, in such maner that no man can be ignorant of the word of God, but he that wilfully shuts his owne eyes for feare to see the light. You are bound vnto them also for this, that the Pope doth now tyrannize lesse ouer you then he did 4 or 5 hūdred yeares past, &amp; that your bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage is eased a fourth part:<note place="margin">Such buls are found in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Paris, and in the third Tome of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, at the end of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Latran vnder Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent the third.</note> for then the Pope gaue those French men that at his commandement armed themselues (besides the remission of all their sinnes) a degree of honour in Paradise aboue other men. But if now at this day he would by a Croysado send the French men into a far country to fight against heretiks, or to conquer certaine townes (vpon his enemies) for him, as he did not long since, you would mock and iest
<pb facs="tcp:11462:15"/> at his commnndement. Then his manner was, when a King had offended him, to interdict his kingdome, and by that meanes (as much as in him lay) to excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate diuers millions of people, to command an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of diuine Seruice to be made throughout a great country, to forbid the bels to be rung, to hinder burials, and to expose the countrey for a prey to him that first could conquer it. England was sixe yeares and a halfe in that state in the time of King <hi>Iohn;</hi> but at this day he puls his sword no more out of the sheath, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that taking so much vpon him, he should be the meanes to ouerthrow his owne dignitie, which the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospell hath already much shaken.</p>
            <p>You are also beholding vnto vs, that sellers of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons run not throughout France from house to house, as they did in the time of <hi>Boniface</hi> the 9. and <hi>Leo</hi> the 10. who for halfe a crowne sold to euery man that would haue them, a remission of all his sins, and the deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a soule out of Purgatory.</p>
            <p>The time hath bin, that in France men commonly spake of miracles, of S. <hi>Anthonies</hi> fire, and of the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rition of damned soules, or such as were come out of Purgatory, which illusions are for the most part vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed away at the rising of the Sun of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which the night of ignorance had hidden. And if at this day there are any small miracles spoken of, it is secretly, and neuer before vs: for before a man that fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth God, and knoweth him, Satan is as it were chained, and loseth all his force, and the magistrates themselues of your religion haue oftentimes punished such impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures corporally. There are not many persons among you that wholly beleeue in their religion, and that find not fault with the Church of Rome. For it is hard for a
<pb facs="tcp:11462:15"/> man to support the Decrees &amp; the Glosses, which say,<note place="margin">Tit. 8. de Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend. cap. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posuit.

               <hi>that the Pope is aboue the law, and that he hath power to dispense against the Apostles and the Gospell:</hi> that call the Pope, God, and Diuine maiestie: or the lying Legends, which in many things compare and equalize S. <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicke</hi> and S. <hi>Francis</hi> to Iesus Christ: or the opinion of those that cause S. <hi>Francis</hi> Cowle to be put vpon them when they are dead, because (as their Doctors say) that Cowle is as good &amp; as auailable as a second baptisme: nor the runnings of poore people for pardons two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles off, when remission of all our sins is offered at home vnto vs by the doctrine of the Gospell: nor the pardons of seuen or eight hundred thousand yeares: nor the priuiledged altars, whereon a Masse being said, a soule is deliuered out of Purgatory: nor the opinion of those that teach, that the Pope can make that which is sin, to be no sin, and that which is no sin, to be sin. And it is certaine, that although we should say nothing, yet the truth speaketh in the consciences of many persons that are holden vnder this captiuity by the feare of men and their domesticall affaires; for the diuell tilleth men by the belly, and rocketh them in a cradle of pleasures and honours to bring them asleepe: whereby it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, that the sparks of the truth knowne, are quenched in them, or if they be not quenched, they burne, and torment their consciences, &amp; serue for nothing else but to make them more culpable. For hauing not onely bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their talent of the knowledge of God in the earth, but also for misspending the same; for hauing bin asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to confesse the Son of God before men, and not defending his cause when time required, and for fearing to offend men more then God, whose promises are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, his threatnings horrible, and his iudgements eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb facs="tcp:11462:16"/> and ineuitable: who hauing in our dayes shewed and done so many miracles to repaire the ruines of his Church in this Realme, wil not leaue those vnpunished that seeke to trouble his worke, and that expresly wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out of the way at high noone day.</p>
            <p>All this which hath bene spoken proceeds from an ardent desire that we haue that you should be saued, and that God might be serued; for herein we haue no other interest then your saluation, seeing that from the defence of this cause, we receiue nothing but trouble, hatred and discommodities. We rather much more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to liue in peace and amitie with our fellow citizens vnder one selfe same religion, if we could or might do it, without offence vnto God; and ceasse not to pray &amp; beseech the Father of mercie (whose compassion sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts our iniquities) that he will pardon those that hate vs, that he will touch their hearts with repentance, and illuminate their vnderstandings with his light, to know the day of their visitation, and the way of eternall saluation, for feare that in the end he should turne his fauour from a people that turne their backs vnto him, and send greater darknesse then the first, vpon a nation that striueth against the light of the Gospell.</p>
            <p>If these considerations moue any man, it will be no small ioy vnto me, and an ample reward of my labour. If it happeneth otherwise, we shal at the least haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered our soules, and discharged our consciences, and serued for a witnesse in so hard and stiffenecked an age, attending till the Sonne of God come from heauen, to heare our griefes, to deliuer his children, and to reward euery one according to his workes: to him be glorie eternally. Amen.</p>

                     <p>He that can reade the Hebrew tongue, knowes well that this accusation is false and vntrue. The Hebrew Bible is the originall of the old Testament; for it was necessary and conuenient, that those bookes which containe in them the doctrine of the people of God, should be written in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall language of the people of God. Now the bookes of <hi>Tobias,</hi> and of <hi>Iudith,</hi> &amp;c. are not found in the Hebrew Bible, how then can we cut those bookes out of the Bible, which were neuer therein? The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Romans, verse 2. saith, that <hi>The diuine Oracles of God were committed vnto the Iewes.</hi> Now the Iewes neuer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged these books. They were not read in their Synagogues, neither did the Priests nor the Scribes euer expound them to the people.</p>
                     <p>The testimony of the Church of the old Testament is of more credit touching the bookes of the old Testament, then the Romane Church that now is. For here I speake of the Iewes; not such as they are at this day, but then when they onely were the Church and people of God. Reade <hi>Iose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi> against <hi>Appion,</hi> alledged by <hi>Eusebius,</hi> lib. 3. cap. 10. There you shall see, that the Iewish Church did not receiue these bookes of <hi>Iudith, Tobias,</hi> &amp;c. And Iesus Christ himselfe and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:11462:18"/> his Apostles, who often and many times alledge the bookes of the old Testament, neuer alledge those bookes: (M. <hi>Arnoux</hi> that saith,<note place="margin">Pag 21. of His answer.</note> that Iesus Christ and his Apostles alledged them in the new Testament, should produce examples for the same.) But those that speake but by here-say, commonly are most bold in their assertions. Iesus Christ in the last of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> verse 44. comprehendeth all the Scriptures vnder the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Prophets, and the Psalmes. Vnder any of these parts, neither the bookes of <hi>Tobias, Iudith, Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, Susanna,</hi> nor the <hi>Machabees</hi> are contained. Hereunto let vs adde the false fables which in these bookes are set downe vnto vs for truth.

                     <p>The Author of the booke of <hi>Iudith,</hi> in the fourth Chapter thereof, verse 2. and Chapter 5.16. speaketh as if this histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie happened after the destruction of the Templo, and after the returne from captiuitie: and yet in the first and second Chapters, this historie is recited as hauing hapned vnder the reigne of <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi> reigning in Nineue, dead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue sixtie yeares before; King <hi>Arphaxad</hi> reigning in Media: but then there was no king <hi>Arphaxad,</hi> for one king then raigned both in Assiria and Media: and likewise Nineue at that time was destroyed, witnesse the last verse of the booke of <hi>Tobias,</hi> conformable to the prophesie of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hum:</hi> and not long before it had bene taken and destroyed by <hi>Cyaxares</hi> King of Media, as <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth in his first booke.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Susannae Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisque ac Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonis fabulas non contineri in Hebraico.</note> and of Bell and the Dragon are fables. And what apparence or likelihood is there, that a handfull of Iewes, captiues in Babilon, should haue Israelites for Iudges in Babilon, that should command one absolutely to be executed to death without appeale, and that a child should make himselfe a Iudge of Iudges, who without other forme of proceeding were condemned to die? Who knowes not, that in Babilon, the vulgar language was Chaldean, and not Greeke?<note place="margin">

                     <p>In the bookes of <hi>Machabees, Antiochus</hi> the famous died three times in seuerall manner: in the first booke cap. 6. he died at Babilon in his bed. But in the first Chapter of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke, he died in the Temple of <hi>Nannaea</hi> ouerwhelmed with stones: and in the ninth Chapter of the same booke he died in the mountaines, falling out of his chariot as he retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned out of Persia; and all that is said to happen in the time of <hi>Iudas Machabeus,</hi> in whose time there was but one onely king <hi>Antiochus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the eight Chapter of the first booke of <hi>Machabees,</hi> it is said, that the Romans had taken king <hi>Antiochus</hi> the Great prisoner, and that they had giuen the Indies to <hi>Eumenes.</hi> All that is false. The Romans ouerthrew <hi>Antiochus</hi> in three bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:11462:19"/> but neuer tooke him prisoner. They neuer had any part of the Indies, their greatest Empire neuer extended it selfe much beyond the riuer Euphrates. See Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> vpon <hi>Daniel, Appian Alexandrine, Zozimus</hi> and <hi>Iustin.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Little children know, that then the Romans euery yeare made two Consuls that had soueraigne power: but in the sixteenth verse of the eight Chapter of the first book of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees</hi> it is said, that the Romans euery yeare committed the gouernment of their Seigniorie to one man alone.</p>
                     <p>In the twelfth Chapter of the first of <hi>Machabees,</hi> there is an excellent thing to be noted, which is, a letter written by <hi>Arius</hi> king of Sparta, to <hi>Onias</hi> the high Priest of the Iewes, wherein it is said, that they of Sparta, (which are the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians,) are of <hi>Abrahams</hi> race. Can there be a foolisher thing alledged? And it is to be found, that in the time of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nias,</hi> there was no such king <hi>Arius</hi> in Sparta. For <hi>Arius</hi> (as <hi>Pausanias</hi> in his Laconiques, and <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the life of <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> say) liued aboue eightie yeares before that.</p>
                     <p>In the first Chapter of the second booke, and nineteenth verse, it is said, that the Iewes were led captiues into Persia, in stead of saying, into Babylon.</p>
                     <p>In the second Chapter it is said, that <hi>Ieremie</hi> hid the Arke of the Lord in a ditch, that it might be found againe when God should reassemble the people, whē they returned out of captiuitie: which is contradicted by <hi>Ieremie</hi> himselfe in the third Chapter and sixteenth verse,<note place="margin">Rabbi Shelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, larki mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no prophetiae Aggaei, v. 8.</note> where it is said, <hi>In those dayes, saith the Lord, they shall say no more, the Arke of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of God.</hi> And in the Temple built againe by <hi>Zorobabel</hi> the Arke was no more there.</p>
                     <p>And at the end thereof, the Author acknowledging his weakenesse, doubteth whether he hath said well or no. If (saith he) <hi>I haue done well, and as it is fitting the Historie:</hi> and a little after, <hi>If I haue spoken slenderly and meanely, it is that which I could attaine vnto.</hi> The Spirit of God doubteth not whether he hath said wel, excuseth not his style, nor confesseth his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becillitie. In the vulgar translation the Author asketh pardon, saying, <hi>If I haue not spoken as I should do, you must pardon
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:11462:19"/> me.</hi> Is it a conuenient thing for the Spirit of God to aske pardon of men? And which is more, in the second Chapter, verse 19. he aduertiseth vs what account we should make of his booke, saying, <hi>We will assay to abridge the fiue books of Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the Cirenien into one volume.</hi> What, shal the abridgment of a prophane booke be a Canonicall booke? To follow the inspirations of the Spirit of God, must we follow the steps of a prophane booke? He also saith that he hath made that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgment with great labour and much watching, as if he had taken extreme paines to make a small booke ful of fables.</p>
                     <p>The booke of the rest of the Historie of <hi>Hester,</hi> in many things contrarieth the booke of <hi>Hester</hi> which is in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Bible. In the first Chapter it is shewed that it happened in the second yeare of king <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> which in the true Historie, cap. 2. vers. 16. is placed in the seuenth yeare of <hi>Assuerus. Haman</hi> is called a Macedonian, cap. 6. verse 10. who in the true Historie is said to be an Agagien, that is, an Amalekite. And this lying booke in the foureteenth verse saith, that <hi>Haman</hi> sought to transport the Empire of the Persians to the Macedonians. As if one should say, that some French man should haue enterprised to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Empire of the Turkes to the king of <hi>Iuetot:</hi> for then the kings of Macedonia were little kings, vnknowne to the Persians, and of no power.</p>

                     <p>This discourse is as much as nothing, for it hath no ground. This Doctor requireth of vs a passage in the holy Scriptures, which containeth the catalogue &amp; number of the canonicall
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:11462:20"/> bookes. I answer, that as to proue there is but foure Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists in the new Testament, it is not necessary to produce a passage which saith, that there is but foure bookes of the Gospell, that is, Saint <hi>Mathews,</hi> Saint <hi>Markes,</hi> Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohns,</hi> but it is sufficient to reade the titles, and to looke ouer the inscriptions of the bookes: so to proue by the Scripture, the number of the canonicall bookes, it suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth to take the Bible in the originall tongue, and looke o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the titles of the bookes. By this meanes you shall there finde all the bookes contained in the article of our Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: &amp; there you shall not find <hi>Tobias, Iudith,</hi> the <hi>Machabees,</hi> &amp;c So the Apostles Creed is found by peeces in the Scripture, although it be not found whole in any one passage alone. The holy Scripture saith, that God is Truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. Then it followeth, that bookes full of lies, as <hi>Iudith,</hi> and the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chabees,</hi> are not the word of God.

For if by these passages they ordinarily dispute against our traditions, as peeces that are out of the formall passage of the holy Scriptures, by the same passages I reuerse their Canon, whereof I finde no formall passage, which to haue, it is necessary that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding

                     <p>To speake properly; The articles of the faith, are the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Christian religion. In this sence, the numbring of the canonicall bookes is no article of the faith, but a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and numbring of the bookes from whence the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the faith and the instructions of Christian religion are drawne. In the same maner, as the numbring of the books of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> is not a precept of Phisicke, but an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signement to the places and the bookes wherein the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Phisicke are to be found; and that is the meaning of our Confession. For seeking by order to set downe the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and doctrines of Christian faith, at the beginning it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth from whence these doctrines are drawne. Which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration is no addition to the Scripture: first, because that this numbring of the catalogue is proued by the Scripture, as we haue shewed. Secondly, by this, that to declare that such bookes are canonicall, (that is, rules of our faith,) it is not to adde any thing to those sacred bookes, but rather to declare that we must not adde any thing vnto them. It is an acknowledgement that we make of their perfection, and of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:11462:21"/> our obedience. When we say that the Scripture is sufficient to saluation, thereby we vnderstand, that we must reiect all those doctrines which adde any thing to the Scriptures. Now to say that these bookes are canonicall, is not to adde any thing to the Scripture, but to declare that we must not adde any thing thereunto. Then it is false that maister <hi>Arnoux</hi> saith, that setting down this number of the canonicall books, we adde something to the Scripture, seeing that on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary we thereby declare, that we must adde nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; for that those bookes are the canon and rule of our faith.</p>

If from the Church, they do vainly attribute the discretion and knowledge of this Canon, to the interior perswasion of the Spirit, and falsely teach in their fift article, that the Scripture is the rule of all that which we ought to beleeue. If from the Scripture, let them quote some formall pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, together with the booke and the chapter, where this Canon is set downe, and the excluding of the rest of the bookes which the Church receiueth: which because they neither do nor can, let them confesse, that this Canon, which is the foundation of all their Beleefe, is grounded vpon nothing, and not vpon the word of God, and by them added to the Scripture.</hi>

                     <p>We haue already confuted that, and proued that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of the canonicall bookes,<note place="margin">Before, 4. Section.</note> contained in the article of our Confession, and the excluding of the rest that are apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:11462:21"/> is clearely proued by the Scripture; and that, if it could not be proued by the Scripture, yet this numbring doth not adde any thing to the Scripture. Touching that which he demandeth, whether we receiue the canon of the Scripture immediatly from the Church of God: I acknowledge, that euery one receiueth the holy Scriptures immediatly from the Church in his country where he dwelleth, whether it be a pure, or an impure and hereticall church; as the Apostles receiued the bookes of the old Testament from the High priests and the Scribes, enemies to Iesus Christ. So the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians and the Eutychians gaue the Scriptures to those whom they taught: but therein the Church (be it pure or impure) onely dorh the office of a witnesse, and not of a Iudge. She attesteth onely, that those bookes are sacred and canonicall, but she maketh them not sacred, nor yet giueth them any authority. The tradition of the Church testifying that those bookes are diuine and canonicall, is but a protesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her subiection to the Scriptures, and not an addition to their imperfection, nor an vsurpation of authority ouer the written word of God. The Booke-seller that sheweth a chapman a booke of the ordinances and laws of this Realme, doth not thereby authorise those ordinances. He that shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the King to a stranger, is not therefore aboue the King, neither giueth authority to the King. An inferior may testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie before a greater person then himselfe. And it hath often times fallen out, that a man hauing receiued the Scriptures by the hands of the church in his country, by the same Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath corrected and iustly condemned the same Church of heresie, from the which he receiued the Scripture. That which is most worthy to be considered of in this place, is, that as the Church attesteth that these books are the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, so the holy Scripture attesteth, that there must be a Church in the world; and that the Scripture abundantly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth what Church it ought to be, and prescribeth lawes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it. So it appeareth, that the testimony which the Scripture giueth of the Church, is much stronger then that which the Church giueth of the Scripture. For the witnesse which the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:11462:22"/> Church giueth of the Scripture, is a simple declaration to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge those bookes to be the word of God, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation to obey them. But the witnesse which the Scripture giueth to the Church, is a rule, and a law, making the Church subiect thereunto: for by the Scripture we vnderstand not the paper and the letters printed thereon, but the diuine instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions contained therein. The Church is compounded of men, who both in grosse and retaile, are subiects to this word, and shall one day be iudged by the same, howsoeuer they (with abhominable pride) brag and boast themselues to be Iudges of the holy Scripture, and giue authority there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.

Annal, anno <hi>1076.</hi> sect. <hi>33.</hi> Quod nullum capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulum, nullus{que} liber Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus habeatur absque illius authoritate.</note> But now at this day, when we speake of the Church, we must by the Church vnderstand the Pope. For the Councell of Rome, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the yeare 1076. vnder <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenth, ordained, that no chapter nor booke should be held to be canonicall, without the Popes authority. Must we haue an approbation
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:11462:24"/> from the Pope to receiue the fiue bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the foure Euangelists for canonicall? What is he that doth not abhorre the impious words of the Romish decree, in the 19. distinction of the Canon, <hi>In Canonicis:</hi> whereof the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription is,<note place="margin">Inter canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas Scripturas decretales epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolae connume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur.</note> That the decrees of Popes are reckoned among the canonicall bookes? Which they proue by a passage out of Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> wickedly falsified.</p>
                     <p>With the like impietie, at this day, they will haue the Church to be iudge of the sence of the Scriptures. There are two kindes or sorts of iudgements, the one a iudgement of discretion, the other a iudgement of authority. By the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of discretion we iudge of meats, not to prescribe lawes, but to discerne what is good for vs. Of this iudgement the Apostle speaketh in the first of the Corinthians, chap. 10. verse 15. <hi>I speake as vnto them which haue vnderstanding, iudge ye what I say.</hi> By this iudgement, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his first epistle chap. 4. will haue vs not to beleeue euery Spirit, but that we should trie the Spirits. But there is another kinde of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is a iudgement of authority; which serueth for a law, and which maketh decrees, against the which it is not lawful to resist: In that maner the court of Parliament iudgeth capitall crimes. Between these two kinds of iudgemēts, there is a third kind, which participateth with the other two, which being a iudgement of discretion, in the meane time hath a kinde of authority: As when diuers learned and wise men giue their aduice vpon any difficult matter; specially if they be men, to whom, by the iudgement of God, we owe respect and reuerence. Whom, (although subiect to erre) and though that they pronounce not iudgement with soueraigne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie and infallible certainty, we are neuerthelesse ashamed to contradict; and we are bound to be content with their iudgement, vntill the thing be better knowne and examined. Such is the iudgement of diuers Pastors assembled in a natio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall or a prouinciall Synode. Whose iudgement neuerthelesse is not soueraigne, but subiect to be examined by the word of God: as latter Councels oftentimes correct precedent Councels. But to esteeme that the Church may iudge of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:11462:24"/> matters of faith, and of the sence of the Scriptures, with a iudgement of soueraigne authoritie, and with infallible cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty; it is a thing not onely vniust, and absurd, but also im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. For, in the question whether the Church is iudge, or not, is it possible that the Church should be soueraigne and infallible Iudge therein? And when question is made, to know what the duety of the Church is, is it reasonable that the Church should be Iudge, with full authority of deciding the same? for by this meanes, she shall be bound to do no more then she will her selfe, and to obey those lawes which she shall giue vnto her selfe. And when question is made of the infalliblenesse or authority of the Church, if the Church be Iudge thetein, she shall be Iudge in her owne cause. See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore, that all the Prelates of the Church are sinners, and by consequence culpable, and punishable by the Law, what apparence is there, that criminalls should be soueraigne and infallible Iudges of the sence of that Law which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth their crime? by this meanes they shall neuer be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. It is a ridiculous and prophane conceit, to imagine that transgressors of the Law should be infallible Iudges of the same Law whereby they ought to be iudged. If the Church were an infallible Iudge of the sence of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, her authority should be much greater then that of God: for such an interpreter would be much more obeyed then the law-maker; for that the people should not be subiect to the words of the law, but to the sence and the interpretation which that interpreter would giue thereunto: which is the meanes whereby the Pope hath made himselfe so great, and so rich; for still he interpreteth the word of God for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and hath proceeded so farre, that in the Romish decrees, there are glosses that say, that the Pope may dispense with the Scriptures, by interpreting rhe same.</p>
                     <p>Neuerthelesse,<note place="margin">Causae <hi>25.</hi> quaest. <hi>1.</hi> Can. sunt quidam. Dispensat in Euangelio in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretando ipsam.</note> let vs say that so absurd and impossible a thing is iust and receiuable; yet, before the authority of a Iudge &amp; an infallible interpreter of the Scripture be referred to a Church, wee ought to be well assured, that the same Church is sound of iudgement, and pure in faith. Into the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:11462:25"/> which examination, if we enter by the Scriptures, then such a Church is subiect to be iudged by the Scripture. Or if to know, whether such a Church is pure in faith, men refer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the iudgement of the same Church, she will be sure not to condemne her selfe. And there is no Church, how cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt soeuer it be, which vaunteth not of her selfe to be pure. And among diuers Churches, as the Syrian, the Greeke, the Romaine, and the Affricane, who all draw their successions from the Apostles, and boast that they haue Saint <hi>Peters</hi> chaire; why should one be iudge rather then the other? Then we must necessarily haue recourse to the Scripture, which is one, and receiued by all; and an vncorrupted Iudge, and wherein, that which is cleare and euident, hauing no need of an interpretation, is sufficient to saluation. Where, if in things necessary to saluation, there are any obscure passages, they are found to be interpreted and expounded in diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cleare passages. For no man but the Law-giuer, can giue interpretations to the Law, that are of equall authority with the Law. And if there be any obscure passages found in the Scriptures, which are not expounded elsewhere, it is better to be ignorant, then to presume to be infallible Iudges of the sence of the Word, by the which God shall iudge vs: for that which therein is cleare and manifest, is sufficient to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>Here the aduersarie doth, as he vseth to do in all other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that is, he changeth the words of our Confession, and maketh vs say things that we do not beleeue; which is a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest and euident proofe that the truth of our religion is very strong, seeing that they cannot dispute against it, vntill they haue first changed it. By this meanes our aduersaries striue not against our Confession, but against their own inuentions. M. <hi>Arnoux</hi> imputeth to our Confession, that it maketh euery man a particular iudge established by God, to approue and reproue the Scriptures, and infallibly to iudge of the sence and translations of them. But the article of our Confession saith nothing so. Therein we speak not of a iudge established by God, nor of iudging infallibly of the sence and interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Scriptures, for none of vs attribute vnto our selues the qualitie of a Iudge, iudging with authority and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible certainty.</p>
                  <p>For to discerne whether such a booke be Canonicall, it is not necessary to haue a particular reuelation: onely we say
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:11462:26"/> two things. The one, that the Spirit of God witnesseth to all Christians that God is no lier, and by consequence he wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth, that the bookes of <hi>Iudith</hi> and of the <hi>Machabees</hi> are not diuine books, because therein vntruths are palpable. The other, that the word of God contained in the holy Scriptures is full of efficacie, and that the Spirit of God vseth the same to touch the hearts without any need of particular reuelation. For he that feareth God, feeleth by a liuely motion, &amp; taketh pleasure in the language of the Spirit of God, which of it selfe maketh a man sufficiently to vnderstand, hauing another manner of vertue then the languages of men. Which vertue, if our aduersaries do not feele, they ought not to mocke at a thing which they know not: but rather therein acknowledge the iust iudgement of God, which doth iustly, to take away from his word the efficacie thereof in them for a punishment, because they do it iniurie, accusing it of obscuritie, ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and imperfection, adding thereunto an vnwritten word, bereauing it of the dignitie to be a perfect rule &amp; soueraigne iudge, to cloath &amp; inuest the Prelates of the Church, &amp; mens traditions with that dignitie. Why should she make her spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall motions to be felt by those that charge her with iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious words, and which forbid and prohibite the reading thereof? Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in the third Chapter of the eleuenth book of his Confessions, acknowledgeth the interior efficacy of the Spirit of God, giuing testimony to our hearts, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth of that which is contained in the Scriptures, and speaketh by experience. Vpon which passage, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his sermon, <hi>De lumine fidei,</hi> saith, this light of the faith, is a certaine testimony of God, by the which it is said vnto the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret cogitations of our hearts, <hi>That is true, thou needest not to doubt thereof.</hi> Euen as he that knoweth not that the Sunne is the Sunne, but onely because his mother told him so, and pointed to it with her finger, should ground vpon a proofe a thousand times lesse cleare then the Sunne: so he that knoweth not that the holy Scripture, is the Scripture, but onely because the Church wherein he liued told him so, without being touched in his heart, with the efficacie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:11462:26"/> groundeth himselfe vpon a proofe a thousand times wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker then the holy Scriptures: which maketh it selfe to be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently felt by those that do not contend and striue against the same, and without the which we should not know, that there must be a Church in the world.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that the Church putteth the Scriptures into our hands. But after that by the same Scripture, God hath touched our hearts, we do no more beleeue that it is the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because the Church told vs so, but because the Scripture it selfe hath caused vs to know it, and that God thereby hath touched our hearts: without the which vertue the testimony of the Church is but a probable aide, which giueth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused beleefe and a light impression. For no man can know, with a certaine knowledge, that the testimonie which his Church giueth to the Scripture, is true, if before that he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that the same Church is orthodoxall, and of a true iudgement touching the faith. Which a man cannot assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, vntill he hath first knowne the rule of the true faith, which is the word of God. To be short, when we are once drawne to the reading and meditation of the Scripture by the testimonie of the Church, and haue begun to taste the same, and to comprehend the doctrine thereof, we may say as the Samaritanes did to the woman, whereof it is spoken in the fourth of Saint <hi>Iohn: Now we beleeue, not because of thy say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for we haue heard him our selues, and know that this is indeed that Christ the Sauiour of the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here I would gladly demand two things of our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: the one, whether they will haue euery faithfull Christian to receiue and approue the holy Scriptures, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, vnderstanding, and comprehending them? To receiue them without knowing any thing in them, is to receiue them without fruite. Or if they will haue the people to haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Scriptures, whether they will haue them to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them, and learning them, that they may be instructed with iudgement and discretion? The other, why they will not haue the people to iudge and discerne that the bookes of the Scripture are sacred and diuine, and yet in the meane time
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:11462:27"/> they will haue them to know and discerne the true Church, to distinguish it from the false? To discerne the true Church from the false, is it not requisite that euery Christian should be particularly assisted, and inwardly conducted by the Spirit of God? If it be so, why will they not haue euery faithfull Christian to haue need of the same assistance of the Spirit of God, to discerne the word of God from the word of men? If for an euasion they say, that to know certainly which is the orthodoxall and pure Church, there is no need of the aide and assistance of the Spirit of God, do they not make their religion prophane, and shew it to be led by opinion, custome, and humane reason?</p>
                  <p>In the meane time, all being well weighed and considered, it will be found that the same iudgment of discretion, which God giueth to the faithfull to discerne the word of God from the word of men, is the same iudgment whereby we discerne the true Church from the false; because that is the true Church, which beleeueth and teacheth the true word of God. Whosoeuer saith, that the people ought to discerne the true Church without discerning the true word of God, speaketh things contradicting one the other, and doth like one that would haue men to know who are iust, without knowing the rule of righteousnesse.</p>

                        <hi>Contrarie passages. Saint Peter in his second Epistle, Chap.</hi> 1.20. No prophesie of the Scripture is of any priuate interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. <hi>Therefore it is contrary to the Apostolicke commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that euery one of you should take vpon him to iudge the true sence &amp; vnderstanding of the Scriptures. The interpreter hath his manner of interpretation, and assureth himselfe to be iudge by a particular spirit, and for a foundation of all that which he shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, layeth this presumptuous and prohibited assurance.</hi>

                     <p>The passage of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> is not contrary to the article of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:11462:28"/> our Confession. S. <hi>Peter</hi> in this passage reiecteth particular interpretations: but in this fourth article of our Confession, there is nothing said of interpretation, nor of the sence or intelligence of the Scripture. This man doth not vnderstand himselfe. And to what purpose should he impugne particular interpretations, seeing that we also condemne them? For it is so farre from vs to receiue the interpretations of a particular man for lawes, that we receiue not the interpretations of a particular Church, how great soeuer it be, when such inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations are giuen for infallible rules, and are equalized in authoritie with the holy Scriptures, as the interpretations of the Popes and of the Romish Church are.</p>
                     <p>It is true, that in our Sermons we interpet the Scriptures, but we giue not our interpretations for lawes: and alledge no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther interpretations of the Scriptures, then those which the Scriptures themselues affoord. Wherby it is not our interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but that which God himselfe giueth.</p>
                     <p>But this requireth a little more discourse, to let you see wherein our interpretations differ from those of the Romish Church: wherein there are fiue notable differences.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The first is, that the interpretations of the Scripture which we bring are drawne out of the Scripture it selfe. But the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church draweth the most part of her interpretations from an vnwritten word, and from traditions. As when the word saith, <hi>Thou shalt worship one onely God, and him onely shalt thou serue,</hi> the Church of Rome vnderstandeth, that the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Latria is here onely reserued vnto God, but that the same hindreth not man from adoring Saints, Images, and the relicks with the adoration of Dulia: but the Scripture speaketh not of this adoration of Dulia giuen vnto creatures. So when the Apostle in the ninth Chapter and tenth verse to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes so often inserteth, <hi>That as it is appointed vnto all men, that they shall once die, so Christ was once offered to take away the sinnes of many, and that by the offering once made he hath sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied vs:</hi> the Romish Church vnderstandeth, that he speaketh there of the bloudy sacrifice; &amp; say, that besides that sacrifice, there is another sacrifice of the body of Christ which is not
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:11462:28"/> bloudy, (that is, the Masse:) but the Scripture speaketh not of this sacrifice of the body of our Lord without bloud. So, when Iesus Christ saith to Saint <hi>Peter, Feede my sheepe;</hi> the church of Rome vnderstandeth that to be said to <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; to his successours, in the charge of the head of the vniuersall Church. But the Scripture saith not, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> should haue successours in his Apostolicall place, as the other Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles also haue had none; &amp; faith not that his successors should be Bishops of Rome. I could produce an infinite number of such examples.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The second difference is, that when we draw an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of a passage in the Scripture, out of the Scripture. we exhort the people to looke into the place, and to reade the Scripture, that euery man may know whether we alleadge it truly, and proceed sincerely therein: according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of those of <hi>Beroea,</hi> in the seuenteenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> who after they had heard the Apostle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> went to conferre his words with the Scripture, to know whether it were so, or not. On the contrary, the Doctors of the Romish Church, interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Scripture to the people, will not haue them to consult with the Scriptures, which in those places where the Pope is absolutely obeyed, is a booke wholly prohibited to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. And in Spaine or Italie, if an Italian or a Spanish Bible be found in any Lay mans hands, it is a crime deseruing bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and an Inquisition case.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The third difference is, That we giue not our interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations for lawes, as if we were infallible interpreters, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make our selues iudges of the holy Scriptures. For we say, that in the cleare passages of the Scriptures that haue no need of interpretations, all that which is necessary for our saluation is contained. On the contrary, the Church of Rome attributeth vnto her selfe, the power to be an infallible iudge of the sence of the Scriptures, and of giuing interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that are of equall authority and force with the holy Scriptures. A prodigious thing, that sinners and guilty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons will take vpon them to be infallible iudges of the sence of the lawes which concerne their crimes and offences:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:11462:29"/> That sinful men should be iudges of that word, by the which at the latter day they shall be iudged. And whereas our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and our wills ought to be subiected to the word of God: that the word of God should be subiected to the sence and meanings of men. That Maister is like to be well serued, whose seruants be the interpreters of his commandements, and thinke it lawfull for them to say to their maister, Thou hast commanded vs to do thus, but we iudge that it ought thus to be vnderstood. This is to subiect religion vnto men, whereas men should be subiects to religion. Certainly, no man but the King can giue interpretations to the Kings pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations and precepts, that should be of equall force and authoritie with the Kings Edict. None but God can bring interpretations to the word of God, which are of as much force and authority as the word of God is. I say, if there be any Prelates that are infallible interpreters of the word of God, and that vpon the sence of the Scriptures pronounce ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reuocable decrees, that such Pastors haue much more autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity then the law of God; because the people are not bound to follow the words of the law, but the interpretation of those Prelates. It were better to be an interpreter in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then to be a law-giuer: and it is impossible that such an interpreter should be subiect to the law. For it is fit that he should be without sinne, lest he should make his interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the law, couertures and cloakes of his sinne.</p>
                     <p>Therein, besides the impietie, the absurditie is most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest; for, before that men should giue the church of Rome the authority of an infallible iudge of the sence of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is necessary to be first assured that it is sound, and of a good iudgement in faith. Into the which iudgement if we enter by the holy Scripture, then the church of Rome is subiected to be iudged by the Scriptures. Now if to know whether the Church of Rome be pure in faith, we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre our selues to the testimony of the church of Rome it selfe, then she is iudge in her owne cause, and she will be sure not to condemne her selfe. So, when question is made, to know what the duty of the Church is: If in this question
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:11462:29"/> the Church be iudge, she is both iudge and partie, and will haue no other lawes but those which she her selfe will make and ordaine. And seeing that in the interpretation of the Scriptures, the Greek, Syrian, Affricane and Roman Churches are different; how shall a simple artificer know which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation is best? seeing the other Churches are ancienter then the Romaine, and boast of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> chaire, and of diuers Apostles? We must therefore come to this point, that if they vnderstand the word <hi>Iudge,</hi> to signifie <hi>Discerning,</hi> (as when we iudge of meates by the taste,) euery saithfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son ought to pray vnto God for grace to iudge, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, and to know the true sence of the Scripture. But if by <hi>Iudging,</hi> they vnderstand, to pronounce decrees, and defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and infallible iudgements, touching the sence of the Scriptures, thereby to binde other mens consciences, there is no man in the world that hath that power. That which is cleare and manifest in the Scripture, hauing no need of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, is sufficient to saluation; or if there be any obscure places, they are clearely expounded else-where. And if there be any passages that are obscure, and can not be vnderstood by other passages, it is better to be ignorant therein, then to play the interpreter with authority of a Iudge. For, for this cause God thought it requisite, that in his word there should be some places that are obscure, among a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of cleare &amp; manifest places; that by those that are cleare he might instruct our ignorance, and by the obscure, proue our sobriety and temperance.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The fourth difference betweene the Interpretations that we make of the Scriptures, and those of the Romish church, is, That they neuer as yet accused vs of wresting the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for our owne profit, nor to haue giuen it a sence which serueth to make vs rich, or to aduance vs to worldly digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; which is one of the great mischiefes in the church of Rome. Couetousnesse and Ambition, that are ingenious to wrest and racke the Scriptures, haue found out and inuented admirable interpretation. In the first Tome of the Councels there is a Decree attributed to <hi>Anacletus,</hi> which saith, that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:11462:30"/>
                        <hi>Peter</hi> is <hi>Cephas,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">
                           <hi>Cephas, id est, caput &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolatus.</hi> It is the 72. in the Hebrew.</note> that is to say, Chiefe or Head, and holding the principall place among the Apostles. In the ninth Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of the last Councell of Lateran, the seuenty one Psalme is alledged, where it is said, <hi>All Kings shall fall downe before him, and all nations shall serue him;</hi> as if it were spoken of the Pope. And a little after, that is attributed to the Pope which Iesus Christ saith in the 28. chapter of Saint <hi>Mathew, All power is giuen vnto me in heauen and in earth.</hi> Pope <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> the eight in the Extrauagant, <hi>Vnam Sanctam,</hi> sheweth, that all the world ought to be subiect to the Pope, because in the tenth of <hi>Iohn</hi> it is written, <hi>There shall be one sheepfold and one shepheard.</hi> There also he proueth the superioritie of the Pope, by that which is written, <hi>In the beginning God created heauen and earth,</hi> For, saith he, there is, <hi>in principio,</hi> in the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular number, and not <hi>in principijs</hi> in the plurall number, which is a notable obseruation. There he proueth, that both the Swords are in the Popes power, that is, both the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and the Temporall, because that in the 22. of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> the Apostles hauing said, <hi>Lord, behold here are two swords, he said vnto them, It is enough.</hi> To the same end he applieth that which God said to <hi>Ieremie,</hi> chap. 1. <hi>See, I haue this day set thee ouer the nations, and ouer the kingdomes. Bellarmine</hi> in his book against <hi>Barkley,</hi> proueth the power of the Pope to depose Kings, by that which is said to Saint <hi>Peter, Feede my sheepe:</hi> also by that, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> will haue, <hi>those that preach the Gospell to liue of the Gospell. Kill and eate,</hi> alleadged by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius,</hi> applied to moue &amp; incite the Pope to thunder against, and to persecute the Venetians, is a ridiculous manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting the Scriptures. I could alleadge a thousand such like interpretations, which are as many confessions of a bad cause, seeing it cannot be defended but by wrested passages, and violent and rash interpretations of the Scriptures. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the churth of Rome vsurpeth the title of an infallible Iudge of the sence of the Scriptures, to the end that where reason wanteth, it may be supplied by authority: for such proofes haue no force, but onely by the authority of him that propounded them.</p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:11462:30"/>
                     <p n="5">5 The fifth &amp; last difference is, that we cannot be charged nor accused to make profane and ridiculous interpretations, thereby to expose the holy Scriptures to be laughed at, as the church of Rome doth. The second Councell of Nice, which our Aduersaries place among the vniuersall Councels, vpon paine of cursing and excommunication commandeth the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration of Images, and faith, <hi>that they are of as much esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation as the Gospell.</hi> To proue this detestable doctrine, the Fathers of that Councell produce diuers passages of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, with a strange compasse, and extrauagant subtiltie: and because the Iconoclastians mocked at those allegations, Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> the first expressely made a booke,<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>3.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Editionis Colon. pa. <hi>205.</hi>
                        </note> and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the same to <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> which is found at the end of the said Councell, whereby he maintaineth all those passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to be well alleadged. The Fathers of that Councel for the adoration of Images had alleadged the passages in the secōd of the <hi>Canticles: Let me see thy countenance, let mee heare thy voice;</hi> and <hi>God created man in his owne image and likenesse, Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>Abraham worshipped the Hethites, Genes.</hi> 23. <hi>Moses worshipped Iethro his father in law, Exod.</hi> 18. <hi>Iacob blessed Pharao, Genesis</hi> 47. and, <hi>No man, when he hath lighted a candle, couereth it vnder a vessell, Luke</hi> 8.16. Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> defendeth these pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages, saying, <hi>Rectè illud protulerunt:</hi> They haue truely allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them, <hi>&amp; valdè nimis atque pulchrè contra eos qui Imagines contemnunt dixerunt, poni lucernam sub modio.</hi> They haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken excellent well, and with a good grace, against those that contemne Images, that they set a Lampe vnder a bushell. What man is he that hath any free or common sence, that wil not detest such prophanation of the Scriptures? And neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, this is the interpretation of the Church, it is a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell that speaketh, and a Pope that defendeth this Councell. He that desireth to see the horrible prophanation of the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of the Scripture, alleadged in manner of a ieast, let him reade those that write of the mysteries of the Masse, and of the ceremonies of the Romish church: As <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, of the mysteries of the Masse; The booke of sacred Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: <hi>Durants</hi> Rational: <hi>Tolet</hi> of the instruction of Priests:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:11462:31"/>
                        <hi>Titleman, &amp;c.</hi> and there he shall finde the Scripture most ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculously wrested. They say, that the Altar must be of stone, because it is said, <hi>Petra erat Christus:</hi> That tapers are set vpon the Altar, because it is written, <hi>I am the light of the world:</hi> That the Priest kisseth the Altar, because in the Canticles it is written, <hi>Let him kisse me with the kisse of his mouth:</hi> That the Priest turneth his backe to the people, because it is written; <hi>Thou shalt see my backe parts, Exodus</hi> 33.23. That the Clarke that serueth the Priest, moueth and stirreth his body as the Priest doth, because it is written, <hi>Where I am, there also my seruant shall be.</hi> That the Priest washeth his hands twise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is written, <hi>Amplius laua me, Psal.</hi> 51. That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop at Masse changeth his hose and his shooes, because it is written, <hi>Put off thy shooes for this place is holy, Ex.</hi> 3.5. With the like subtiltie the Pope at this day, when he is crowned, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth certaine copper money among the people, saying, Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and gold haue I none, but that which I haue, I giue thee. Where religion is changed into a Comedie, it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell that the Scriptures are exposed vnto laughter, and turned into a ridiculous sence. Thus much touching the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which father <hi>Arnoux</hi> saith to be receiued from the hand of Gods Spouse, that is (as he vnderstands it) the church of Rome. Thus you may see how the word of God is dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously alleadged, and God worthily serued.</p>

                  <p>For if by the Church, our aduersaries vnderstand the Church of the elect predestinated to saluation, which S. <hi>Peter</hi>
                     <pb n="31" facs="tcp:11462:31"/> in his first Epistle, cap. 2. calleth <hi>a chosen generation,</hi> and with the Apostle to the Hebrewes, cap. 12. calleth, <hi>The assemblie and congregation of the first borne which are written in heauen:</hi> It is a great absurditie to aske, if that Church assembled to iudge the differences of religion may erre: seeing that it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer assembleth to decide any point of faith.</p>
                  <p>If by the word <hi>Church,</hi> they vnderstand the vniuersal visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, which is, the assembly of all those that make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession to be Christians, it is no lesse absurd, to aske if that Church assembled to iudge the points of faith can erre: for that now it is impossible for the same to be assembled: for it is composed of different parts, that is, of the Greeke, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, the Syrian, and the Affrican Churches, &amp;c. which are particular Churches, separated from communion. For who shall assemble them? who shall set them at agreement? who shall be arbitrator of their discord? who shall be president in that assemblie? seeing that euery one of them attributeth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to herselfe the perfections &amp; testimonies which God giueth to his Church in his word.</p>
                  <p>But if by the word <hi>Church,</hi> our aduersaries vnderstand a particular Church, as that of Rome, of Antioch, or of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople, they themselues confesse, that euery particular Church may erre: and say that the Church of Ierusalem foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Iesus Christ, and that of Antioch founded by <hi>Peter</hi> erred.</p>
                  <p>The holy Historie witnesseth, that the Church of Israel, which vnder the old Testament was the onely Church in the world, oftentimes erred. It was idolatrous in Egypt, Ezech. 20.7.8. The people in the desert worshipped the golden Calfe, to the which also <hi>Aaron</hi> the high Priest erected an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, and proclamed a solemne feast vnto it, Exod. 32. <hi>Ʋriah</hi> the high Priest erected a pagan altar in the Temple of God, 2. Kings 16. In the fifteenth Chapter of the second of Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles it is said, <hi>Now for a long season Israel hath bene without the true God, and without a teaching Priest, and without Law.</hi> Which cannot be vnderstood of the ten Tribes that reuolted from the couenant of God, for that a little after he addeth,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:11462:32"/> that they turned againe vnto God, but those ten Tribes neuer turned. <hi>Ieremie</hi> in cap. 2.27.28. reprocheth the Church of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, that it had had as many gods as townes; &amp; that the Kings, Priests, and Prophets, said vnto the woods, Thou art my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is the language of idolaters. He maketh the like complaints, cap. 5.31. and cap. 6.14. and <hi>Esay</hi> cap. 56. saith, <hi>His watchmen are blind, they are all ignorant, they cannot barke.</hi> It is hard to maintaine that the high Priests, Scribes, and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises, that held <hi>Moses</hi> chaire, and the ordinary succession did not erre in the faith, when being assembled they decreed, that whosoeuer did confesse Iesus to be Christ, should be cast out of the Synagogue <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.12. which is one of the causes (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many others) for the which Iesus Christ warneth his disciples to beware of the leauen of the doctrine of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rises, in the sixteenth of S. <hi>Mathew:</hi> whose instructions Iesus Christ would haue the Iewes wholly to obserue when they preached in <hi>Moses</hi> chaire, but not when they preached against <hi>Moses,</hi> and against the Law. For that is not a succession, but an ouerthrowing of the chaire and the doctrine. Among the which <hi>Caiphas</hi> the high Priest &amp; head of that succession, iudged that Iesus Christ was a blasphemer and worthy of death, Math. 26. Then when the said prelate in the eleuenth of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> prophesied that one man was to die for the whole nation, he did not prophesie, because the infallible truth was fixed to his chaire, but God inspired him extraordinarily, to the end that that prophesie whereby the price and the vertue of the death of Iesus Christ is declared, might be of more weight and authority among the Iewes, in regard of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the person.</p>
                  <p>Then, if the Church which was the onely Church in the world, and the Pastors that onely held the chaire erred, is it credible, that the Church being deuided into contrarie Churches, in chaires separated from communion, one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church may or can presume, not to erre, and to subiect all others to her will? without producing her priuiledges? and contrary to the experience of so many ages? and the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all antiquitie?</p>

                  <p>The sixt Councell held in Constantinople in the thirtenth Canon condemneth the Church of Rome by name, because she reiected married Priests; and in the fiue &amp; fiftieth Canon because she fasted on the Saturday. Then those fathers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued that the Church of Rome could erre. The Greeke and the Romane Churches ioyned together in the second Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Nice: did they not erre, when in that Councell they decreed, (vpon paine of cursing and excommunication,) that images ought to be adored, and that they are of as much estimation as the Gospell, and that the image is better then the word, where in the tradition it is said: <hi>Maior est imago quàm oratio?</hi>

And you must note, that then there was a question about a point of doctrine, which was, whether the Pope may dispence with an oath made to God, and whether he ought to be held to be lawfull Pope, that hath receiued the Papacie contrary to the oath which he had made neuer to take it on him.</p>
                  <p>Did not the Church of Rome erre in the Councell of Rome holden vnder <hi>Gregorie</hi> the seuenth, anno 1076. where it was declared and defined,<note place="margin">Baron Annal. anno 1076.</note> that there was no other name vnder the heauens but that of the Pope? and that no booke is canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call without his authoritie, and that all kings ought to kisse his feet?</p>
                  <p>Did not the Councell of Rome erre in the Councell of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tran, vnder <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, where power is giuen to the Pope, to dispossesse and driue Princes that are excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate out of their lands and Signiories? cap. 3.</p>
                  <p>Or in the Councell of Constance holden anno 1414, where she declared, that we must neither obserue faith nor promise with heretickes, and that it is lawfull to put them to death after safe conduct is giuen them? And that to haue the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:11462:33"/> to receiue the Sacrament vnder both kinds, following the example of Iesus Christ and the ancient Church, is rashnesse, and an heresie punishable by the secular power?</p>
                  <p>Or in the Councell of Florence, holden anno 1440: where it is decreed that the Pope may adde to the Creed?</p>
                  <p>Or in the last Councel of Latran, where the holy Scriptures were laid at the Popes feet, and he called a king most like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God? where also it is said, that all people ought to adore him: that he hath all power both in heauen and earth, that he is the Lyon of Iuda, the Roote of <hi>Dauid,</hi> the Sauiour of Sion, and the diuine Maiestie?</p>
                  <p>Lastly, shall the Church of Rome continue pure and entire then, when (according to the opinion of our aduersaries) An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist shall abolish the Masse? or at the time whereof Iesus Christ speaketh, Luke 18. <hi>Thinke you when the Sonne of man cometh, that he shall find faith on the earth?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To be short, to say that she cannot erre, is a language that onely belongeth vnto God, or to him that maketh himselfe to be God,<note place="margin">2. Thess. 7.</note> whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the sonne of perdition. The Apostles neuer bragged that they could not erre, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding that the Spirit of God guided them in all truth. Whosoeuer saith, I cannot fall by ignorance, is partly fallen by pride: whosoeuer saith I cannot erre in the interpretation of the Scriptures, makes himselfe infallible Iudge of that doctrine by the which one day he shall be iudged. He that is fallen shall neuer rise againe, as long as he presumeth that he standeth. He will not be subiect to any rule as long as he thinketh himselfe to be the rule: and there is no riches nor dignity whatsoeuer vpon earth, whereunto he will not aspire, seeing that no man may contradict him. By this meanes the Scripture will be held and esteemed to be of little necessitie: for what need I studie, if a man that cannot erre leadeth me directly vnto heauen? If God, to the end that the people should not be seduced, hath giuen those Prelates the vertue not to erre, it is wonder that he did not likewise giue them the vertue neuer to be vicious, seeing that nothing causeth Atheisme sooner to breed among the people, then the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:11462:33"/> liues of Pastors, whereof being conuinced it maketh the doctrine contemptible. The Canon, <hi>Si Papa,</hi> in the fortieth Distinction, teacheth vs that in most expresse termes, which saith: If the Pope being negligent of his owne saluation, and of the saluation of his brethren, vnprofitable and slack in his businesse, and besides that doing no good, in the meane time he leadeth after him, being himselfe first a bondslaue of sin, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable multitudes of people into perdition, to be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with him by many plagues: no man may presume or dislike of him for the same, because he that ought to iudge all men, ought not to be iudged by any man, if he be not found to haue erred from the faith. This speech certainly is diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall: and yet he, that to flatter the Pope hath vomited out so many impieties, freely acknowledgeth that the Pope may erre from the faith. Whereupon I am, and haue often times bene abashed, wherefore the Pope that vaunteth that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not erre in the deciding of doubts, abstaineth (now many yeares past) from pronouncing any definitiue sentence vpon the controuersie which is in the Church of Rome, about the questions of freewill and predestination: for the which the Iacobins and the Iesuites in Spaine are at continuall strife. The props wherewith they support this proud doctrine are so weake, that if you blow vpon them they are ready to fall. They alledge vnto vs, that it is said in the second chapter of <hi>Malachie: For the Priests lips should keepe knowledge, and they should seeke the Law at his mouth, for he is the messenger of the Lord of hoasts.</hi> But it is a great abuse to make a promise of that which is a commandement. And those Priests of whom it is here spoken, seduced the people and corrupted the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, as it is said in the next verse.</p>
                  <p>They also alledge, that Iesus Christ in the sixteenth of Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> promised that the gates of hell should not preuaile against the Church: but there he speakes not of any particular Church, nor of Rome, neither yet of the vniuersall visible Church; which although the power of the diuell cannot vtterly abolish it, yet he often preuaileth against her diuers wayes, corrupting some by vices, seducing others by heresies,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:11462:34"/> and dissipating many particular Churches by persecution. <hi>The beast shall make warre with the Saints, and ouercome them,</hi> Apoc. 13. The Church flieth before the red Dragon, Apoc. 12. In that passage our Sauiour speaketh of the elect Church, which cannot be seduced, nor depriued of saluation by the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the diuell, as Iesus Christ teacheth in the thirteeenth of Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> saying: <hi>For false Christs shall arise, and false Prophets, and shall shew signes and wonders to deceiue, if it were possible, the very elect.</hi> Where if he speakes of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall visible Church, his meaning is, that Sathan can neuer abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish it.</p>
                  <p>But specially our aduersaries make shew of the 15. verse of the third chapter of the first to <hi>Timothie,</hi> where the Church is called <hi>the house of God, the pillar and ground of truth.</hi> The abuse consists herein, that they take that which is but a description of her dutie, to be an infallible perfection of the Church. The Apostle thereby teacheth vs, that the Church is established in this world to defend and support the truth; but saith not, that it cannot faile in her dutie. So false Churches are pillars and grounds of lies, but it followeth not from thence, that they can neuer turne to the truth. To thinke or esteeme that the truth of God is grounded vpon men, is to make mans autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie firmer then Gods truth. On the contrary, the Apostle to the Ephesians the second chapter, saith, that we are built vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles:<note place="margin">

So the ancient Fathers vnderstand it. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> in the eleuenth homilie vpon the first of <hi>Timothy</hi> saith, The truth is the pillar and ground of the Church. And <hi>Irenaeus</hi> in the first chapter of his third booke saith, They haue left vs the Gospell in the Scriptures to be a pillar and the ground of our faith. Our aduersaries themselues say it without thinking thereon, as often as they ground the authority of the Church vpon this and other such like places, for thereby they silently confesse that the authority of the Church is grounded vpon the Scriptures: and so (not knowing it,) dispute against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. And it is certaine, that whosoeuer groundeth the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:11462:34"/> of the Scriptures vpon the authority of the Church, bereaueth the Church of the meanes to ground her authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie vpon the Scriptures, &amp; neuer ought to alledge the Scripture for a ground of the Church. He that buildeth the walles vpon the foundation, supposeth that the foundation is not groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the walles: So if the Church be the foundation of the word of God, it is not grounded vpon the word of God. Why then do they ground the authority of the Romane Church vppn this passage?</p>
                  <p>Now after all this, if it were granted vnto them, that the word of God is grounded vpon the Church, they haue gotten nothing, if they do not also proue that this Church is the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine, rather then the Greeke or Syrian Churches, which are ancienter then the Romane, and purer, and also boast of the succession of Saint <hi>Peter.</hi> They also to the same end apply the words of our Lord in the sixteenth of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> verse 13. <hi>Howbeit when he is come, which is the Spirit of truth, he will leade you into all truth.</hi> This promise properly belongeth to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, whereof they receiued the full accomplishment vpon the day of Pentecost, when the holy Ghost descended vpon them, and taught them the truth of the doctrine of saluation. And if this promise should appertaine vnto the Church, and should be perpetuall in al ages, yet by that, the infalliblenesse of the Church is not hereby proued, much lesse the infallible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of any particular Church.</p>
                  <p>They also alledge the passage of the eighteenth of S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew: If thy brother trespasse against thee, tell it vnto the Church; and if he refuse to heare the Church, let him be vnto thee as an heathen man or a publican:</hi> but this place shall be examined hereafter when <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> obiects it against vs.</p>
                  <p>For the infalliblenesse of the Romish Church they alledge, that Iesus Christ said to S. <hi>Peter</hi> Luke 22.31. <hi>Simon Simon, behold Sathan hath desired you, to winnow you as wheate but I haue prayed for thee that thy faith faile not.</hi> Marke that two lines after, he foresheweth to <hi>Peter</hi> that he should deny him three times. So it appeareth, that by those words Iesus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth him against the temptation and promiseth not to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:11462:35"/> him nor to suffer his faith to faile. Which is euident, for that by the word <hi>faith,</hi> he vnderstandeth not the doctrine, but the trust and confidence in Iesus Christ: and by the word <hi>faith,</hi> he vnderstandeth not to erre in the doctrine, but to fall by weaknesse. But what makes that for the Romish Church? doth all that is said to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> or that is said by S. <hi>Peter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Pope?<note place="margin">Math. 16.

                     <p>It is false that in this place Saint <hi>Paul</hi> condemneth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior perswasion of the holy Ghost and I am abasht how it is possible that a man which maketh profession to teach Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinitie dares deny that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was led by an interior per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of the holy Ghost. For in the Acts 13.9. it is said, that <hi>Paul</hi> was filled with the holy Ghost:<note place="margin">Gal. 1.12.</note> and a little before in the passage which <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> alledgeth the Apostle saith, that he had receiued the Gospell by reuelation from Iesus Christ, which could not be, vnlesse Iesus Christ inwardly touched his heart by his holy Spirit, therein to imprint the doctrine of saluation. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the first chapter of his first Epistle
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:11462:35"/> saith, that the Apostles preached the Gospell by the power of the holy Ghost; in the sixteenth of the Acts the holy Ghost forbiddeth S. <hi>Paul</hi> to preach the Gospel in Asia. And if S. <hi>Paul</hi> refused the perswasion of the holy Ghost to be a rule, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the iudgement of the Apostolicke colledge for a rule, we must say, that he preached three yeares without rule, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had no conference with any of the Apostles till three yeares after his conuersion, Gal. 1.7. and 18. where S. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that when it pleased God to reueale his Sonne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he returned not againe vnto Ierusalem to those that had bene Apostles before him, but went into Arabia. Three yeares after he went to Ierusalem to conferre with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, not to receiue or take any rule which he had not before, but to the end that this conference might be a publicke pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of concordance, without the which he and the other Apostles had runne in vaine, and their labour bad bene fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse.

It is false, y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we beleeue nothing but that which is distinctly set downe in the holy Scriptures: for we beleeue many things which are not found distinctly nor in so many words in the Scripture, but are therein set downe in equiualent words, and by consequence necessary: As that the Church of God shall continue for euer: That God by his prouidence gouerneth all things: That in the diuine essence there is a Trinitie of persons: and diuers such proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are easily proued by the Scriptures, although they are not found there in so many precise words: in the same manner that <hi>Apollos</hi> proued by the Scripture,<note place="margin">Acts 18.</note> that Iesus was that Christ, although it be not distinctly and in so many sillables found therein. For if we must receiue no more but that which is distinctly in so many words contained in the Scripture, no man should be bound to beleeue in Iesus Christ; for in the Scripture it is not said, that <hi>Charles</hi> or <hi>Henry</hi> ought to beleeue in Iesus Christ: onely there all men are comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to beleeue in Iesus Christ. From whence the dutie of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular men to beleeue in Iesus Christ, by consequence is drawne. It is false that by this fifth Article we renounce all Antiquitie and Councels; for we onely say, that neither An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquitie nor Councels ought to be opposed against the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. It is false, that we would establish the glosses and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretations of any particular Minister, as we haue shewed in

                  <p>Lastly, it is false that we reiect Traditions, seeing that the Scripture it selfe is a Tradition: and that there are many things which concerne Ecclesiasticall policy and exterior order, which are not specified in the Scripture. We onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect those traditions, which being receiued, it would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon follow, that the Scripture containeth not all the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which is necessary to saluation.</p>
                  <p>Such is the vnwritten word, whereunto our aduersaries haue recourse, when the Scripture faileth them; and that heape of humane traditions, which are equalised in authority with the holy Scriptures, which we affirme to be the rule of all truth, and to containe all that which is necessary to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and proue it by these passages: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the third chapter of the second Epistle to <hi>Timothie,</hi> verse 15. speaketh thus vnto his disciple, saying: <hi>From thy infancy thou hast knowne the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise vnto salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through the faith which is in Iesus Christ.</hi> Then the holy Scriptures containe all that is necessary to saluation, seeing they can make vs wise vnto saluation by beleeuing in Iesus Christ. For what do we seeke for more, then to be wise in such manner, that we may be saued by beleeuing in that word which teacheth the faith in Iesus Christ?</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith of the same word, that <hi>it is able to saue our soules,</hi> Iames 1.21.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the first to the Corinthians cap. 4.6. bounding or limiting the power of Pastors and their authority in the Church, saith, that <hi>no man presume aboue that which is written.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same Apostle in the twentieth of the Acts verse 27. saith, <hi>For I haue kept nothing backe, but haue shewed you all the counsell of God.</hi> Then it followeth euidently, that the traditions of Popes and of the Church of Rome, added from age to age, since Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time, are none of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of God.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth of Deuteronom. verse 2. &amp; in cap. 12.31. God saith: <hi>you shall not adde vnto the word which I command you, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall you diminish ought from it.</hi> Then, if it was forbidden
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:11462:37"/> to the Iewes to adde any thing to <hi>Moses</hi> law, when there was no other doctrine to saluation but that, there is no appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, that now at this day, the law of <hi>Moses,</hi> the Prophets, the Euangelists, and the waitings of the Apostles, are not sufficient, and that it is allowable to adde traditions &amp; an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writen word thereunto.</p>
                  <p>None of our aduersaries euer yet durst denie, that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Gospell is sufficient to saluation, and that the Gospell is not wholly &amp; entirely set downe in the new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: otherwise, the title should be false, and we must change the title and right part of the Gospell, and after seeke the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part in the vnwritten word. We must also change this word of Testament, which is set at the begining: if that book be but a part of the Testament of the Sonne of God. And we must no more call those bookes canonicall, if they be no more the entire rules of our faith.</p>
                  <p>The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Ephesians, cap. 2.20. groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our faith vpon the Prophets and Apostles: <hi>And are built</hi> (saith he) <hi>vpon the foundation of the Apostles and the Prophets.</hi> If our faith be grounded vpon the vnwritten word, it must haue another ground then that of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. For how should we know that this vnwritten word comes from the Apostles? But it is easie for vs to note the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, the Authors, and the times of the most part of the traditions of the Church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>In the sixteenth of S. <hi>Luke,</hi> verse 19. the wicked rich man prayeth <hi>Abraham</hi> to send one from the dead vnto his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to warne them of their duties, lest they should fall into the like torment: to whom <hi>Abraham</hi> answered and said, <hi>They haue Moses and the Prophets, let them heare them.</hi> Which eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently sheweth, that they ought to content themselues with <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, which the Church had in their hands, without other reuelation.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Esay</hi> cap. 8.20. God reproueth his people, because they seeke to familiar spirits &amp; vnto wisards, and sends them to the word contained in his Law: <hi>To the Law, and to the Testimony; if they speake not according to this word, it is because there is no

                  </p>
                  <p>In the Galat. cap. 1.8. it is said, <hi>But though we or an Angell preach vnto you otherwise, then that which we haue preached vnto you, let him be accursed.</hi> Note that he saith <hi>otherwise,</hi> and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>that which we haue preached vnto you.</hi> Although it is to be vnderstood, that all doctrine in matter of saluation, that is without, is also contrarie to the Scripture: seeing it is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the prohibition to adde to the word of God, and that God forbids vs <hi>to teach mens precepts for doctrine,</hi> Matt. 15.9. A litle before that the Lord had condemned the Pharises, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they trangressed the commandement of God by their traditions.</p>
                  <p>Whose traditions if they be considered, you shall find, that they were doctrines, that commaunded not things to be done that were expressely prohibited in the law of God, but simple additions, &amp; voluntarie deuotions out of the word of God; as to make cleane the outside of the platter, to wash their hands before they did eate with scrupulous deuotion; to tythe Mint and Cumin, to weare long garments, to fast three times a weeke, to make long prayers: to make consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to heale a sicke man vpon the Sabboth day. Such also were the traditions, touching the distinctions of holy dayes, &amp; abstinence from certain kinds of meats, which said, <hi>eate not, taste not, touch not,</hi> Colos 2.16, 21. not vpon an opinion, that those meates were vncleane, but <hi>by voluntarie deuotion and humilitie of spirit, to tame the flesh, and not to care for the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of the flesh;</hi> as the Apostle saith in the same place. Of all which traditions the Apostle in the same chapter, verse 8. saith, <hi>that it is a vaine deceit, through the traditions of men.</hi>

And yet I heare diuers men say, that the Fathers and ancient Councels are contrarie to the Church of Rome: and that there is not any one in the primitiue Churches, that speaketh of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping of Images of forbidding the people the chalice, or the reading of the holy Scriptures: or of the adoration of the host with Latria; of Romane Indulgences, of priuate Masses, of prayer that is not vnderstood by him that prayeth; of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Scripture to the people in a tongue which they vnderstand not; of the power of the Pope to giue and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way kingdomes at his pleasure, and to draw soules out of Purgatorie.</p>
                  <p>In all these things the truth is so strong, that <hi>M.

If the Scripture sends to the Church to learne that which is not in the Scripture, by this sending she confesseth her imperfection. By the like reason, I may say, that a man which cannot reade, giues sufficient rules to learne Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, when he sendeth or directeth one to a good Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher to be taught. I must adde hereunto, that when <hi>M.

Then we must know how to discerne them: how should we discerne them but by the rule set downe and propounded in the word of God▪ This doctor therfore manifestly mocketh those that are his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="46" facs="tcp:11462:39"/> what meanes they shall discerne the good and orthodoxall Pastors, from wicked and heretickes, and the pure Church from the impure and hereticall.</p>
                  <p>The truth will yet apeare more euidently when we shall haue seene &amp; examined vpon what passages of the Scripture, our aduersaries ground their traditions. Iesus Christ (say they) in the 16. of Saint <hi>Iohn.</hi> verse 12. saith, <hi>I haue many things to say vnto you, but you cannot beare them now.</hi> And thereupon they would make vs beleeue (without proofe) that those things which the Lord had yet to say, are the Traditions of the Church of Rome, as the Inuocation of Saints, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of meates, the obseruation of feasts, the single life of priests, the Popes succession in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> chaire as head of the Church the priuate Masses the drawing of soules out of Purgatorie, &amp;c. This is a bold diuination, for his owne profit. But there is no need to diuine, when Iesus Christ ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth himselfe: for in the verse following he declareth what those things were that he had yet to say, and which the holy Ghost should declare vnto them: which is, that the same Spirit should tell them things to come: which are those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies, which the Apostles afterward foreshewed, viz. that there should a sonne of perdition come, that should call him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe God, and should worke wonders and miracles: that there should false Doctors come, that should teach men to abstaine from mariage and from meates: that there should one come that should be clothed in scarlet, that should se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce kings, and should haue his seate in the Citie that stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon seuen hilles.</p>
                  <p>They obiect also, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> hauing in his first Epistle and the 11. chapter, to the Corinthians propounded and set downe the forme and institution of the holy Supper, as he had receiued it from the Lord, in the 34. verse addeth: <hi>Other things will I set in order when I come.</hi> I answer, that it can not without impietie be denied, that Iesus did institute the holy Supper as it ought to be, without omitting any thing of that which was necessarie: whereupon it followeth necessarily, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reserued vnto himselfe at his comming, the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:11462:39"/> exterior order, and that which concerneth the decencie of the action. It is also by no meanes to be beleeued, that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had set downe the institution of this holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, had an intent to mend it, and to contradict that which he himselfe had ordained. Then the things which he reserued for himselfe to ordaine, are not those things which the Church of Rome hath added to this Sacrament: whereby she ouerthroweth the Lords institution. For Iesus Christ did not lift vp the host, he commanded not the people to adore the sacrament, he offered nothing to God in sacrifice, hee speaketh not of sacrificing, he gaue both kinds to all men, he spake in a tongue knowne to all: he asked not saluation of God for the merits of the Saints whose bones were hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vnder the altar: he turned his face to the people, and not his backe. To be short, he did all things cleane contrary to that which the priest at this day doth. And such contrary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions, to the institution of Iesus Christ, they call Apostoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call traditions; therein vsing the Gibeonites subtiltie, who coming but a little way, fained to come from a farre country: for they couer their owne inuentions, with the faire cloake of antiquitie, and vnder colour of adding, change and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the institution of the Lord. <hi>M.

                  <p>If those two places were ill quoted, yet the article of our Cōfession would neuerthelesse be firme, seeing it is proued by so many other passages which <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> dares not meddle withall. One onely place of the Scripture is sufficient to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish a doctrine: which cannot be ouerthrowne, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing all the proofes wherevpon it is grounded. So all that which <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> doth, serueth to establish this Article of our Confession, seeing, that saying nothing against the other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are quoted, he approueth them by his silence.</p>
                  <p>Neuerthelesse these two passages taken in their true sence, and to the end for the which we alledge them, will be found to be fitly applyed. By them we beate at the traditions that adde any doctrine which is not contained in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: the authors whereof our aduersaries themselues do set downe vnto vs, and tell vs, that such and such a Pope added this peece to the Masse, that such and such a Pope, that liued so many yeares since the Apostles times, made this order and decree, which was neuer practised before. Against that, we alledge the words of Iesus Christ, <hi>These things haue I spoken vnto you, that my ioy might remaine in you, &amp; that your ioy might be fulfilled.</hi> And that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith to the Ephesians in the 20. of the Acts, <hi>for I haue kept nothing backe, but haue shewed you all the counsell of Christ.</hi> For if these additions, and new traditions of Popes, long since added, are necessarie to saluation, it is impossible that the ioy of the Apostles, and of their disciples was accomplished: neither did the Apostles declare all the counsell of Christ. For that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> by the counsell of Christ manifestly vnderstandeth the Gospell. Now it were impietie to say, that the new Testament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth but a part of the Gospell:<note place="margin">Verse 21.</note> for if that were so, the title should be false, and we must put a peece, or halfe of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:11462:40"/> in the title. And to conclude, the Apostle in the very same place sheweth wherein the counsell of Christ consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth: to wit, in repentance towards God, and faith in Iesus Christ: which are two points fully and amply taught in the holy Scriptures. By the way, I pray you note <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which speaketh of bandying of passages, as if he were playing at tennice.</p>

For in the verse following, Iesus Christ declareth what those things were which they
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:11462:41"/> could not yet beare, that is, things to come, as the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies touching future euents, which are found in the Epistles of the Apostles,<note place="margin">Quia non posset ex his inueniri ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas, ab his qui nesciant traditionem.

About twenty yeares after the death of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> one of his Disciples named <hi>Papias,</hi> Bishop of Hierapolis, beganne to hearken to vnwritten traditions, as parables and strange doctrines, and other fabulous things; as <hi>Eusebius</hi> writeth in the last chapter of the third booke of his historie.</p>

                        </gap>.</note>These heretikes wanted no successors: the most fertile Church for traditions hath beene the church of Rome: for that of a Bishop not worth sixe pence in substance, to make an earthly Monarch that exceedeth Emperours and Kings in worldly wealth, honour and riches, it was necessary to make great additions, and to patch long peeces to the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent doctrine. And it is manifest in the Histories to be seene, that as the B. of Romes greatnesse increased, traditions were multiplied; which are much more recommended by our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries then the holy Scriptures, and more religiously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. For in Rome adultery is permitted, but flesh is strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden to be eaten in Lent. The reading of the Bible prohibited, and Images erected in the Churches. Bishops dispence with the Apostles commandement, that will haue them not to be nouices, but fit to teach and instruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; for the most part of them preach not, and many Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprickes are giuen to children. But touching Annates and reuenues belonging to the Papall Seate, those are inuiola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly obserued. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> dares presume, and proceedes so farre, as to say; that some traditions are greater, touching the obseruations thereof, then some Scriptures, chap. 7. of the booke of the vnwritten word. We haue oftentimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired to see a list of those traditions, and of that vnwritten
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:11462:41"/> word reduced into one body, but our Aduersaries would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer giue vs the catalogue thereof. Two things hinder them from it: The one is, that they know, that whatsoeuer they do, yet a wauering doctrine will hardly be firmly imprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the mindes and spirits of men, if it be not supported by Gods authority, speaking by the Prophets and Apostles: The other; that if they should deliuer a list of those traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the common people, they would be abashed at their great number, and desire to compare them with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, wherein they should finde great contrarietie with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers traditions: in such manner, that those traditions would rather be found to be corrections, vnder pretence of traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And which is more, there they should finde traditions to be forbidden, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.3. <hi>Why do you also transgresse the commandement of God, by your tradition?</hi> and Colossians 2.8. <hi>Beware lest there be any man that spoile you through philosophie and vaine deceit, through the traditions of men.</hi> This abuse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therein so palpable, neuerthelesse <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ground traditions vpon the holy Scripture; therein contradicting the Church of Rome, which on the contrarie, will haue the authoritie of the Scripture to be grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on tradition: whereby it followeth, that the authority of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition cannot be grounded vpon the Scripture. To proue it, he alleadgeth the fifteenth verse of the second chapter of the second Epistle to the Thessalonians; <hi>Therefore brethren, stand fast, and keepe the instructions</hi> (or traditions) <hi>which you haue beene taught, either by word or by our Ep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Our difference is not, whether a short Epistle written by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> but whether the olde and the new Testaments doth containe all that which is necessary to saluation. And which is more, if Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had said, <hi>Stand fast and keepe the instructions which you haue beene taught, either by our word, or by

Arnoux</hi> addeth a place out of the seuenteenth of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> and the eleuenth verse, which confirmeth that. For there God saith, Thou shalt do all that they shall teach, according to the Law. Iesus Christ mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not that they should be obeyed when they teach any thing against the Law: for the rule of the fourth of the <hi>Acts</hi> is without exception, that we must not rather obey men, then God.</p>
                     <p>The second passage alleadged by M. <hi>Arnoux,</hi> is, the eighteenth of Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> where Iesus Christ saith, <hi>Tell it vnto the Church, and if he refuse to heare the Church, let him be vnto thee as a heathen man or a Publican.</hi> From whence it is inferred, that in matters of doubt touching faith, we must goe to the catholike Romish church, which is an infallible iudge.</p>
                     <p>I answer, that our Aduersaries alleadging this place, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it three wayes; first, they say, that by this place, Iesus Christ establisheth the Church to be Iudge of the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersies in Religion, and of points of faith. But there our Lord speaketh not of points of faith nor of doubts in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion but of quarrels between two particular persons; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:11462:46"/> the one hath offended the other: Iesus Christ speaketh of the censure of maners, and not of doctrine. <hi>If</hi> (saith he) <hi>thy brother hath sinned against thee, &amp;c.</hi> To say, that if the Church hath authority to iudge of quarrels betweene two particular persons, by greater reason she hath authority to iudge of points of faith with authority and infallible certainty; is to dispute with as good probability, as if I should say, that he that can carry a burthen that weigheth an hundred weight, by greater reason may carry a burthen of a thousand weight. Secondly they will, that by the word, <hi>Church</hi> we must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the vniuersall Church: which is impossible; for, for to end a quarrell betweene two neighbours, we assemble not the vniuersall Church. We must go to a particular Church, which all men confesse to be subiect to errour, and namely, in that which is spoken of in this place that is, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing admonitions, and vsing of censures, wherein faults are committed, either by passion or by ignorance. In the third place they will that by the Church we must only vnderstand the Roman, which is a rash supposition, without any colour. For if two Christians haue a quarrell in Syria, or in Ethiopia: must they go to the Romane church to end their difference? And in doubts of faith, why should not the Syrian or the Greeke Churches as well be Iudges, which are much anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enter then the Romane, and haue Saint <hi>Peters</hi> chaire, and from whom the church of Rome hath receiued Christian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion?

                     <p>To these three eminent corruptions of this passage, our Aduersaries adde two apparent kindes of iniustice: The first, that this place, being one of those whereon they ground the authoritie of the Romish church: neuerthelesse, the church of Rome wil be the onely iudge of the sence of this place. In a case where she is party, and where her greatnesse and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie is to be decided, she will be absolute and infallible iudge. By this meanes she will be sure to giue sentence with her selfe, and be well assured to win her cause.</p>
                     <p>The other iniustice is much worse, for when a question is made, to know the true orthodoxall Church, that men may follow it; the Romish church taketh all meanes possible from the people, of knowing whether her Pastors teach the true doctrine, or not: for that, to examine the doctrine of her Pastors by the holy Scriptures, is a thing not permitted to the people. To learne the resolutions of doubts by reading of the Greeke and Latine Fathers, (the length and multitude whereof is infinite) is a thing which the people vnderstand not. If we must be saued by that meanes, all women, and plaine countrey and vnlearned people, are damned. In such manner, that to know whether the Church wherein we liue be a Church well grounded in the faith, there resteth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes for the poore people, but to beleeue their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, who will be sure not to condemne themselues.

                     <p>Then he needed not to speak of the foure principall points of controuersie, whereof he saith the examination belongeth to the Priest: wherein neuerthelesse he wrongeth himselfe, to name morall commandements besides the Decalogue or ten commandements. The Doctors of the Romane church, (as well as we,) draw all the morall instructions and docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of good life and conuersation, from the Law of God. Let the Reader marke by the way, the impious words of the Iesuite, when he termeth the holy Scripture to be a dumbe rule: vnder pretence that it hath neither mouth nor throate. Our aduersaries writings are farced with such iniuries against the word of God. <hi>Baile</hi> the Iesuite, whose mouth <hi>M.

                        <hi>Bellar.</hi> compareth and equaliseth the testimony which the holy Scripture yeelds of it selfe, to be diuine, to the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony which the Alcoran of <hi>Mahomet</hi> giues of it selfe, to be descended from heauen. There also he saith, that the Scripture is but a peece of a rule. Doctor <hi>Charron</hi> in his third truth saith, that the Scripture is a two handed sword, and that by it men become Atheists. Thus one of them after another call the Scripture diuinely inspired, a dumbe rule, as if it were a woodden rule; which he durst not say of the Kings procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, published and set on the posts, although the paper hath no voyce. And although the word of God contained in the Scriptures makes no sound in the paper, yet it hath a sound in the mouth of the Sonne of God, and of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and when God published the Law in the middle of fire: which ought to haue the like force as if God at this day spake from heauen.</p>
                     <p>What? shall the commandement of God pronounced by his owne mouth, (Not to haue any other god but himselfe, and not to fall downe before or worship any image) be estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

                     <p>They serue their turnes also with another reason, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaue the holy Scripture of the title or office of a Iudge, by saying, that the Church is ancienter then the Scriptures.

                     <p>But notwithstanding all these considerations, the ancient Fathers made no difficultie to acknowledge the Scriptures for Iudge. <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> in the seuenth booke of Tapistries faith, In the seeking out or examination of things, wee make the Scripture our Iudge.

Although Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third in the Bull, <hi>Ad liberandum,</hi> which is at the end of the Councell of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tran, speakes as though he should be Iudge at the latter day, and signifieth vnto all those that would not go on the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age into the East, nor contribute any thing towards the same, that they should answer for it vnto him at the terrible day of Iudgement.

                  <head>Of the prouidence of God, and how God conducteth the actions of the wicked, without being author of sinne, or participating with their vices.</head>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Section. </seg>21</label> Three maximes or generall rules serue for the ground of this matter. The first is, that all things are gouerned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the prouidence of God. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Ephes. 1.11. That <hi>God worketh all things after the counsell of his owne will.</hi> The second is, that God is soueraignly iust, and is not the author of sinne, neither inciteth man to do euill: as it is said in the 45. Psalme, and 7. verse: <hi>Thou louest righteousnesse, and hatest wickednesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third is, that man is the cause of his owne destruction, and that he sinneth by his owne will: as God saith by the Prophet, <hi>Hosea</hi> 13.9. <hi>O Israel, thou hast destroyed thy selfe, but in me is thine helpe.</hi> Euen as in the generation of creatures ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall causes worke with the inferiour, and if any imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hapneth, as when a monster is ingendred, that imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection is neuer imputed to the celestiall, but to the inferior causes, and to the euill or bad disposition of the matter. So in voluntary actions, although God moueth and sustaineth them, neuerthelesse if any default hapneth, it ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the will of man, and not to God. Whosoeuer recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not these three maximes, defendeth the reprobates cause, casteth the cause of their destruction vpon God, and will teach God to be iust, or bind him to yeeld an accompt of his actions.</p>
                  <p>But the holy Scripture oftentimes vseth diuers manner of speeches, from whence prophane men take occasion to make God author of their sinne, as if God had thrust them into it, or as if necessitie to sin, had bene imposed vpon them by the will of God, which man cannot withstand. For example the children of <hi>Iaacob</hi> by a wicked conspiracie, sold their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ioseph</hi> to be carried into Aegypt, whereof behold what <hi>Ioseph</hi> saith, Gen. 45.7. <hi>God sent me before you, to preserue you a posteritie in the earth, and to saue your liues by a great deliuerance.</hi>
                     <pb n="70" facs="tcp:11462:51"/> Whereby it appeareth, that the selling of <hi>Ioseph</hi> was done by Gods prouidence. And in the first of <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.25. it is said, <hi>That the children of Ely hearkened not vnto the voyce of their father, because the Lord would slay them.</hi> And in the 25. chapter of the 1. of kings, 10. verse: <hi>A wicked spirit came before the Lord, and offered to make the Prophets lie, to whom God said, thou shalt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade them, and preuaile also, go forth and do so.</hi> In the second of <hi>Samuel</hi> chapter 16. <hi>Semei</hi> curseth <hi>Dauid</hi> with execrable speeches, whereupon <hi>Dauid</hi> said, <hi>So let him curse, because the Lord hath said vnto him, curse Dauid.</hi> And in the 12. chapter of the same booke, God intending to punish the murther and adulterie committed by <hi>Dauid,</hi> said, that he would raise vp euill against him in his owne house, (that is, the rebellion of his owne sonne,) and that he would take his wiues before his eyes; and after addeth, <hi>For thou didst it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel.</hi> So God suffered the diuell to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict <hi>Iob,</hi> and the Caldeans to rob him of all his goods: and all that historie is recited to haue bene done by the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God; and therefore <hi>Iob</hi> said, <hi>God giueth it, God taketh it, blessed be the name of the Lord. Ieremie</hi> in his Lamentations 3.37. speaketh thus of the desolation of the Iewes by the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilonians: <hi>Who is he that saith, and it cometh to passe, when the Lord commandeth it not? Out of the mouth of the most highest, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth not euill and good?</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in Acts 4.28, speaking of the conspiracie of the Iewes, of <hi>Herod,</hi> and of <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> against Iesus Christ, saith, they gathered themselues together to do those things which the hand and counsell of God had determined before to be done. Thereby shewing, that all the euils committed against Iesus Christ, were not done without the counsell of God. The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the first to the Romans, speaking of prophane men and infidels, saith, that God gaue them vp to their hearts lusts, to vncleannesse, to vile affections, to a reprobate minde, to do those things that are not conuenient. And God declareth, Exod. 10. and Romans 9. That he hardened <hi>Pharaos</hi> heart. Gods words to the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> in the 6. chapter verse. 10, are fearefull, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their eares heauie,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:11462:51"/> and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and heare with their eares, and vnderstand with their heart, and conuert and be healed.</hi> Words, which being wrung and wrested by some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane man, might giue him occasion to make God the cause of his infidelitie.</p>
                  <p>But lest that any man on the one side should abuse these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Scripture, to brand the iustice of God, or to make him author of sinne, or ro excuse libertines and prophane persons, as if God had constrained them to do euill; and lest that on the other side we should derogate any thing from the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, esteeming that the wickednesse which man committeth happeneth without his prouidence, Diuines pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and set down certaine doctrines and distinctions, which are reduced into the sixteene propositions herafter following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The holy Scripture speaketh vnto vs of two sorts or kinds of the will of God, the one the commandement of God, the other, the decree of his prouidence. The first is the rule of his righteousnesse which is manifested vnto vs, the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is the decree of his secret counsell. The first ruleth and gouerneth our thoughts, words, and works: the second dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth and ordereth the euents of all things which happen and are done in the world. We are bound onely to obey the will of God, which is his Law, without enquiring or making question of his secret decrees, and the determinations of his prouidence, Deut. 29.29. The sonne that prayeth vnto God for the health and recouerie of his father that is sicke, doth a worke acceptable vnto God, and according to his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, although his prayer be conrrary to Gods decree, and his counsell, whereby he hath decreed that his father shall die of that disease. The wicked are not excusable in the execution of wickednesse or euill for hauing serued Gods se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret decree, which the diuels also execute. For we shall not be iudged according to that whereby we haue serued God in his secret decree, but according to the measure whereby we haue obeyed Gods commandements.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 To speake properly, the decree of God onely, which is a determination of his prouidence, is the will of God. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:11462:52"/> his commandements, they are rather a rule of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and a declaration of that which God approueth, and which man is bound vnto, then a will decreed or determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 When we say, that the decrees of the counsell of God are hidden from vs, we must except those which God hath made manifest vnto vs by the execution and accomplishment ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and those that are declared vnto vs in the word of God, although they are not yet fulfilled: as the decrees of the counsell of God, touching the destruction of Antichrist, and of the resurrection and the iudgement to come.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 There are two kinds or sorts of euill, the one is the euil of the fault, the other the euill of punishment. The first euill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from man, the second commeth from God, that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth the sinnes of men: neuerthelesse the euill of the fault sometimes serues for the euill of punishment; when God in his wrath, withdraweth his grace and assistance from a man, because he abuseth it by ingratitude. And then that brydle and restraint being broken, men giue themselues ouer to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which draw them into destruction. Then the euill of fault which serueth for a paine or punishment, proceedeth not from God, as it is the euill of fault, or as it is sinne, but God onely maketh it serue for a punishment.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 God permitteth or suffereth sinne. For if God would let or hinder man from sinning, he is powerfull enough to do it. As Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 9.19 saith, <hi>Who is he that can resist his will?</hi> This permission is not a forcible, but a voluntarie permission: no man hath constrained him to suffer sinne to enter into the world. Therefore then he hath of himselfe permitted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. God will haue nothing but that which is good. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was good that God permitted euill, for those reasons which he knoweth better then we do. So then that which we perceiue thereby is, that by that meanes God is much more glorified: for if there were no sinne committed in the world, we should not know Gods iustice in punishing of sinne, nor his mercy in pardoning of sinne, nor his infinite loue in the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:11462:52"/> mysterie of the incarnation of his Sonne haue bene reuealed. Not that God hath any need of the sinnes of men to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine his glory, and his beatitude; but I say, that God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing determined to make man perfectly happy, by this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinne, the way to leade a man to this perfection is opened. For if man had not knowne what sinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is, he could neuer haue attained to a perfect knowledge of the goodnesse and iustice of God. The finall end for the which all things are made, is, that God might be glorified: and withall the Scripture teaching vs, that God punisheth one sinne by other sinnes. If God onely permitted this pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment contrary to his will, it should not be a punishment of a Iudge, who neuer punisheth by permitting the culpable to be punished, but by commanding. Looke, touching this punishing of one sinne by another sinne, in Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> lib. 5. cap. 3. against <hi>Iulian.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6 There is none but God, that permitting euill can turne it into good: but men ought not to suffer or permit sinne, nor to do it, vpon hope that good may come thereof. The Pope that permitteth the stewes in Rome, to shun and preuent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domiticall sinne, as they say that seeke to excuse him, doth not remedie that euill; for Sodomiticall sinne ceasseth not still to be committed there. Adde hereunto, that the actions of God, are not the rules of our life, but his commandements.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 The permission whereby God permitteth the wicked to sinne, is not a vaine or idle permission, but such as bridleth the wicked, to the end that they should not passe the limits of the prouidence of God, or to do hurt vnto those whom God will blesse and preserue. For although the will of man be corrupted, yet God hath not lost his power, whereby he conducteth all things, and keepeth mens wils in subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, euen those that resist his knowne will, which is his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 There are two faculties in the soule of man, that is, the vnderstanding and the will; the one, whereby man knoweth; the other, whereby he moueth; the one, whereby we are wise or ignorant; the other whereby we are good or
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:11462:53"/> euil: That which is in the vnderstanding, is to affirme or deny; that in the will, is to desire or shunne. God neuer puts euill desires into the will of man, nor inciteth him to do euill, but sometimes in his wrath blindeth his vnderstanding. For as a master doth well to put out his schollers candle, when he seeth that he employeth the night in leudnesse, or to reade wicked bookes: so God taketh away the light of his knowledge from those that abuse it by ingratitude. As Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> 12.40, saith. <hi>He hath blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Now as it may happen to that scholler being without light, to stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and to hurt himselfe, vnlesse his master guide him: so af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God hath blinded the vnderstanding of any man, he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into vices and addicteth his mind vnto euill, vnlesse God guideth him. So we must vnderstand that which God saith in the Psal. 81.12. <hi>I gaue them vp vnto their owne hearts lusts, and they walked in their counsels.</hi> Looke Acts. 14.16. and Rom. 1.25.26. It may also be said, that God hardeneth the hearts of the wicked, in setting before them meanes proper and wholsome for saluation, as his word and his sacraments; and not giuing them grace and vertue, to serue him as they should, whereby it happeneth, that of themselues they waxe worse, God by that meanes punishing their peruersitie. This hardening of the heart, which followeth by accident of the blinding of the vnderstanding, is the reason whereby the Scripture saith that God hardeneth the heart of the wicked. And yet to shew that the ground of this hardening procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from man, the Scripture doth not only say, that God har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened <hi>Pharaos</hi> heart, but also that <hi>Pharao</hi> hardened or exas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated his owne heart, Exod. 8.15. But there are two kinds of those whom God hardeneth, as also there are two kinds of hardening. For besides that hardening which is cōmon to all reprobates that haue abused the knowledge of God, there are some men wickeder then others, whom God deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Satan by a particular iudgement, and an extraordinary manner, as <hi>Pharao, Saul,</hi> and <hi>Iudas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="9">9 Euen as the Sunne is not the cause of darkenesse, (for of his owne nature he produceth nothing but light) although
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:11462:53"/> darknesse necessarily succeedeth when it is gone downe: So God is not the cause of sinne; for of his nature he is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes it selfe, although irregularity, sinne, and disorder of affections necessarily ensue when he hath withdrawne his grace. Some say, that the Sunne withdrawing it selfe, is the cause of darknesse, not the efficient, but the defectiue cause. But these termes are harsh, and ought not to be attributed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: as also that by this distinction a thing that is no more, (as a light put out) might be called a defectiue cause. Now that which is no more, can in no manner be a cause. But the absence thereof may well be a cause of the truth of some affirmation.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 Although the wicked worke voluntarily of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and without God being any cause of their sinne, yet the euents that happen thereby, are directed by his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. For, as the water of a spring, by nature is inclined to runne downeward, but by mans industrie is drained, and by channels made to runne where &amp; which way he will: so the wicked are of themselues inclined to euill, and God moueth them not to do euill, but directeth their wicked wils to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute one thing rather then another, by his secrct iudgement to punish those whom he will, and to exercise and trie his children. The Wise man in the 21. of the Prouerbs vseth this similitude, saying: <hi>The Kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the riuers of waters, he turneth it whither soeuer he will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11 God slacketh or looseth the bridle to Sathan and to the wicked, to execute their wicked intents, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from themselues, and not from God: neuerthelesse, all whatsoeuer they shall do, shall serue to effect the counsels of God. And as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>They shall do those things which the hand and the counsell of God had determined before, Acts</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>Euen as horsleaches applied to a mans body, intend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but to fill themselues with blood; but the Phisitians end who applieth them, is to heale his patient: So the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, by whom God serueth his turne to chasten his children, haue no other end, but to satisfie their inordinate lusts and desires. But God making them his instruments, hath a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:11462:54"/> to the saluation and instruction of his children. See <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi> 10.6.7. Howsoeuer God vseth the seruice of the wicked, in such manner that he constraineth not their wils, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not from them their free choice, which in the wicked is most free to do euill.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 As God is necessarily good, and yet most free and without constraint; so the diuell and those whom he gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth absolutely, are necessarily euill, and yet do euill with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out constraint, and with free libertie. Necessitie is not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to libertie, but constraint. Necessitie is so much the stronger, when it is voluntarie. If man were driuen to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill by a compulsiue necessity and not voluntary, God should be vniust to punish him.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 We must carefully distinguish the action from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prauation or imperfection which is in the action. It is one thing to go, and another thing to halt as we go. The soule which moueth a lame man maketh him go, but maketh him not halt. That which is naturall (as going) comes from the soule. That which is vicious, is accidentall, and proceedeth from some other thing. So the action whereby a man sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, is one thing, and the defect and deprauation in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, another thing. There is great difference betweene the naturall mouing of the murtherer to kill, and the vice or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance to the Law of God, which is in the action. That which is naturall in this action, proceedeth from God; <hi>For by him we haue life, mouing, and all things, &amp;c.</hi> Acts 17.25. And wee cannot stirre nor moue without his aide. That which therein is vicious comes from man and not from God.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 We must carefully distinguish these three things, the will to sinne, the execution of this will, and the euents which follow this execution. For example, in the selling of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> the treason and the crueltie was in the hearts of his brethren, and came from them, and not from God. The execution thereof, which is the selling of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> was also done by them, but directed by the prouidence of God. The euents that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, as the exaltation of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> and the preseruation of the people of Israel, are purely and simply effects of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:11462:54"/> of God. Wherein there is nothing so easie as to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniate, by interpreting that which some of vs shall haue said of the execution, or of the euents after the execution: as if his meaning were to speake of the will to sinne.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 As in naturall workes or actions, God sustaineth and moueth all creatures not onely by a generall vertue, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by his particular assistance: So we must say, that to moue mens wils to good, and to direct the wils of the wicked to the end and intent that God hath purposed, God ruleth and assisteth, not onely by his generall aide, but also by his particular prouidence: seeing it appeareth that the effects which follow, as the death of Iesus Christ happened by the wickednesse of the Iewes, and the preseruation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God by the selling of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> are things manifestly guided by the speciall prouidence of God.</p>
                  <p n="16">16 When God looseth the bridle to Satan, to tempt man, well may the diuell solicite him, or present obiects vnto him to tempt him, or by some alteration of the humors of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, moue his fantasie, but he hath no power ouer the will of man, to constraine him to sinne: otherwise, God should be vniust to punish man, and all the fault should be in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.</p>
                  <p n="17">17 Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> vseth hard termes in this matter, which neuerthelesse, by the distinctions aforesaid, may be mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In the twentieth chapter of Grace and Freewill, spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Semei</hi> cursing <hi>Dauid,</hi> vpon that which God had said to <hi>Semei,</hi> curse <hi>Dauid:</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Non enim iubendo dixit vti obedientia laudaretur, sed quod eius voluntatem proprio vitio malam, in hoc peccatum iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sto suo iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio &amp; occulto inclinauit.</note> God (saith he) did not command him to do it, that his obedience might be praised, but because God, by his iust iudgement, did incline his will to that sinne, which was euill by his owne fault.<note n="*" place="margin">Operatur Deus in cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus hominum ad inclinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das eorum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntates quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cun{que} volue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, siue ad bona pro sua misericordia, siue ad mala pro meritis eorum.</note> And chapter 21. God worketh in the hearts of men, to incline their wills which way he will, either to good by his mercie, or to euill accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their merits.</p>
                  <p>And in the fifth booke against <hi>Iulian,</hi> the third chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, The peruersitie of the heart cometh not without the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret iudgement of God, which maketh men not to hearken to the truth, and by that means they fall into sin: and so, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:11462:55"/> sinne is the punishment of precedent sinne. And a little after, Then God giueth them ouer to villanous desires, to do things that are not conuenient: but he giueth them iustly ouer, and so those sinnes become punishments for sinnes past, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites for future sinnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> followed him, in his commentarie vpon the ninth to the Romans, the third Lecture, where after he hath said, that God suffereth some to fall into sinne, for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of precedent iniquities, he addeth: I am of opinion, that in this place there is more to be vnderstood: that is, that by a certain interior instinct men are moued by God to good or euill. Therefore also Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his booke of Grace and Freewill saith, that God worketh in the hearts of men to incline their wils which way it pleaseth him, whether it be to good, according to his mercie, or to euill, according to their merites.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is intollerable in the fifteenth chapter of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond booke, of Falling from grace, and the state of sinne. The second meane (saith he) is, that wee vnderstand that God moueth and prouoketh some men to euill, or that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth them to do euill, and that he vseth them as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, because he suffereth them to do euill. And in the 14, chapter, By the iudgement of the most mighty God, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent sinnes, man is in such sort destitute of diuine aide, that it is impossible for him morally not to fall. After he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth from whence this necessitie of falling cometh; that is (saith he) because God doth not call him, nor moue him so, as he seeth it fit and requisite for him, that he may follow Gods calling him, that is, vouchsafeth him not congruent grace for him in this estate.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:11462:55"/> entire, and conformable vnto the Image of God, by his owne fault, fell from the grace that he had receiued, and so alienated himselfe from God, who is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of all righteousnesse and of all goodnesse, in such manner that his nature is wholly corrupted; and being blinded in his spirit, and depraued in his heart, hath lost all integritie, without any remainder thereof. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he hath some knowledge to discerne good and euill, notwithstanding we say, that what light soeuer he hath, it is turned into darknesse, if the question be of searching after God; insomuch, that by his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and reason, he can no way come neare him. And although that he hath a will, whereby he is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to do this or that, yet it is wholly captiuated vnder sinne, in such sort, that he hath no libertie to do good, but that which God giueth him.</q>

                     <hi>It is one thing to say, that without the grace of God we can do no good, tending to life euerlasting, and to the glorie of Iesus Christ; which is true; and another thing to say, that doing that good by the aide and motion of grace, we do it as being constrained, pressed, and drawne vnto it, without the vse of our owne Freewill: which is the scope of this Article, ouerthrowing the Image of God in man, (that is, libertie) and supplanting the grounds and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of vertuous and commendable actions.</hi>

                  <p>To speake in this manner, it is not to examine our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, but to forge another to striue against it, and so to make sport. For wee beleeue nothing of all that which hee maketh vs to say, but detest the doctrine which he attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth vnto vs. For in our ninth Article there is not one word
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:11462:56"/> of all that which he maketh vs to say. We say not, that we do good by constraint; wee take not the liberty of mans will from him: we know that the good which the children of God do, they do it voluntarily, and without constraint. This is our beleefe.</p>
                  <p>Man is considered two wayes, either such as he is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or such as he is after he is regenerated, and led by the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>Touching man not regenerated, and such as he is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, see what the Scripture teacheth vs, Genesis 6.5. God saith, that <hi>Euery imagination of the thoughts of mans heart is onely euill continually:</hi> and, Gen. 8.21. <hi>The imagination of mans heart is euill from his youth.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romanes 5.12. saith, that <hi>By one man sinne entred into the world, and death by sinne, and so death went ouer all men, inasmuch as all haue sinned.</hi> And to the Ephesians, 2.1.5. saith, that <hi>We were dead in tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passes and sinnes,</hi> and that <hi>God hath quickned vs.</hi> From whence the Scripture calleth this changing into a better life, a second birth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3. and a regeneration by the incorruptible seed of the word of God, 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 1.23. and a resurrection A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalyps 20.6. The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Corinthians 2. chap. 3. verse 5. saith, that <hi>We are not sufficient of our selues to thinke any thing, as of our selues, but our sufficiencie is of God.</hi> Then, if we be incapable of our selues to thinke any good thing, how much more to do any good thing? The same Apostle in the 1. Corinthians chap. 2. verse 14 saith, that <hi>The naturall man perceiueth not the things that are of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishnesse vnto him.</hi> And, Romans 8.7. <hi>The wisedome of the flesh is enmitie against God, for it is not subiect to the Law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These places, and such like, proue vnto vs that which our Confession saith, that mans nature is altogether corrupt, and that man is blinde in spirit, and corrupt in his heart.</p>
                  <p>To the which proofes we adde the places, which say, that faith and the loue of God, and to be short, all vertues that are in vs pleasing to God, and all the good that we do, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth not from vs, but are gifts of God, as it is said in the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:11462:56"/> Ephesians 2.8.9. <hi>For by grace ye are saued through faith, and that not of your selues, it is the gift of God: not of workes, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>st any man should boast himselfe.</hi> And Philippians 2.13. <hi>It is God which worketh in you both the will and the deed euen of his good pleasure.</hi> So the Lord, Mathew 16.17. saith to Saint <hi>Peter: Blessed art thou Simon, the sonne of Ionas, for flesh and blood hath not reuealed it vnto thee, but my Father which is in heauen.</hi> Therefore also in the 11.25 he gaue thanks to his Father, for that he had hidden those things from the wise and men of vnderstanding, and had opened them vnto babes. From the same spring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth the loue that we beare to God, Ioh. 1. cap. 4.20. <hi>We loue God, because he loued vs first.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By all these proofes, we intend not to take from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and vnregenerate man, all freedome of will: we know well, that in naturall actions, which are ruled by the will, as to eate, and to go; and in ciuill actions, to sell, contract, build, and trauell, man freely chuseth among many obiects. Of this liberty in ciuill things, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh 1. Corinth. 7. where he saith, That the woman after the death of her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is at liberty to marrie againe, and putteth it to the choyce of the father to let his daughter marrie or to keepe her a virgine. We say more, that is, that man hath his free will in good and honest actions, belonging to ciuill honesty: as the actions of Pagans, which helpe vp a man that is fallen downe, and set him in the way againe that hath lost his way. I say the same touching the obseruation of Ecclesiastical policy wherein the essence of piety consisteth not; and of all good works, touching the exterior action, as to giue almes, sing to the praise of God, &amp;c. And which is more, we say that the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man sinneth very freely, and without constraint, and betweene two euils chuseth very freely. And this is the same liberty which imposeth on him the necessity to sinne, because he is naturally subiect to his will, naturally euill. Therein consists his mischiefe that he is too free to do euill, so that his freedome is the cause of his seruitude. Now this necessity to sinne is not repugnant to the freedome of the will. Witnesse the diuels, which are necessarily and naturally
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:11462:57"/> wicked, and yet sinne most freely and without constraint: So God is necessarily good, and yet most free. It is not necessity but constraint that ouerthroweth the freedome of the will.</p>
                  <p>In all these things we say that vnregenerate men haue their free will and free choyce, onely the word of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaueth them of this liberty,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.14. Eph. 2.1.</note> and calleth them bondslaues, sold to sinne, yea dead in sinne, in regard of Christian ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which leade men vnto saluation; as the true knowledge of God, and of faith in Iesus Christ, and of the true feare and loue of God, the end and purpose whereof is the glory of God, and the hope of saluation in Iesus Christ. To all these things man naturally hath no inclination, no mouing, nor no free will at all, as we haue shewed by places of the Scripture. It should be hard in the good theefe crucified with Iesus Christ, or in the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> before his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion, to find any preparations or dispositions to conuert or turne vnto God: which preparations our aduersaries call merits of congruitie: which surely is a great incongruitie in faith.</p>
                  <p>Touching the regenerate, and such as are conducted &amp; san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the Spirit of God, we are so farre off from saying that they do good by constraint, that on the contrary we say that they do it willingly, and take pleasure therein. He that doth good by constraint, doth euill. And God sheweth mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy vnto him, if he pardoneth such a disobedience. Although God hateth euill, yet he will not constraine men to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, because goodnesse is no goodnesse if it be not volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary. But he boweth the wils of his children, and maketh them willing to worke with him. In such manner neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, that all whatsoeuer they cooperate and that will it selfe which they haue to do good, proceedeth from God: <hi>Which worketh in vs both the will and the deed euen of his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> Phil. 2.13. Euen as the infant formed in the wombe stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth of it selfe, and is an helpe to his owne conseruation and birth: &amp; yet all that vigor or strength in him proceedeth from God: so is it with regeneration and spirituall birth. To giue
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:11462:57"/> God all the praise and glory of our good workes, is not to hinder good works, no more then to giue God all the praise of the framing and birth of the child, is to hinder the birth of the child, or to diminish his vigour. God preuenteth those that will not, to make them will, and aideth those that will, that they may not will in vaine He commandeth whatsoeuer he will, and doth that in vs which he commandeth: he doth it by a sweete efficacy, and by an attraction without constraint, whereof Iesus Christ speaketh, Ioh. 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me draw him.</hi> The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Eph. 4.24. saying, that <hi>the new man is created after God vnto righteousnesse and true holinesse:</hi> calleth our regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration a new creation. Now as in the creation, the impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue words of God were operatiue: so in our regeneration, his word is full of efficacie to transforme mens hearts. So when the Lord spake to the dead body of <hi>Lazarus</hi> saying, <hi>Lazarus</hi> come forth; by those words he infused life into him againe. And as our Lord commanded the Iews to vnbind <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> bands wherewith he was bound, that he might be loose, so in the spirituall resurrection, he vnbindeth vs from the seruitude of sinne, that we may serue him freely, and with a good will. This is that which our Confession saith, that man hath no freedome or will to do good, but that which God giueth him. Then it acknowledgeth a freedome or will in the faithfull, but that it is a gift of God: which freedome be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing opposed and crossed by the combat of concupiscences, increaseth as God augmenteth his graces, and the worke of regeneration proceedeth in vs.</p>
                  <p>The summe of all that which is said before, is this, that the vnregenerate man hath free will in naturall things, in ciuill things, and in wicked things, but not in diuine things, which leade to saluation. As for the regenerate man, the good that he doth, he doth it voluntarily and without constraint, and in this sence diuers ancient Fathers say, that the faithful haue free will, but if by hauing free will, we vnderstand, that it should be in the free will of a man that is not regenerate to haue true faith, and to turne vnto God with hearty repentance, or
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:11462:58"/> that the good which we do, and the faith in Iesus Ch ist, and the true knowledge of God, partly proceed from our natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall forces, or that before regeneration there are prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, dispositions, and merits of congruity in man: (as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phisters prattle,) we reiect that free will, as contrary to the word of God, and not onely say, that God vnbindeth our will which is restrained, but that he wholly giueth the will and the force of motion to do good. Our aduersaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, saying that man can do no good without Gods assistance, deny free will: for he is not free to go, that cannot go except the bands that bind him be vnbound, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being holden vp after he hath bene bound. They say, that in an vnregenerated man free will is bound, and restrained. As much to the purpose, as if I should say, that a free man is a bond man. For how can the will be francke and free, if it be bound and restrained? Surely, he is not free, that being laid downe cannot rise againe, if another man doth not lend him his hand. For the grace whereby God releeueth vs, is not in our disposition; God doth not onely sollicite our wils, by shewing obiects, or by propounding reasons fit and proper to perswade, but also giueth the desire, and changeth the will. He doth with efficacy produce <hi>to will and to do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his good pleasure.</hi> For if he changeth the hearts of his enemies, as the heart of <hi>Esau,</hi> Genes. 33.4. and of <hi>Saul</hi> 1. Sam. 19.23. and of the Egyptians, Psal. 105.25. And if he holdeth the hearts of kings, to encline them as he will, Prou. 21.1. How much more doth he touch the hearts of his elect, to turne them vnto him with a voluntary conuersion?</p>

                     <p>Our aduersaries haue vsed to produce this place, to proue that it is in our power to chuse good, and to leaue euill: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God saith <hi>chuse,</hi> for (say they) God commandeth no impossible things. But they contradict themselues: for <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> said before, that man can do no good thing, without the grace of God. Now this grace of God is not in our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: we beare not the keyes of this treasure. God giueth not his graces to euery one, but to whom he will. Neuerthelesse, this commandement is giuen vnto all men, to chuse good, &amp; to shun euill, and that to those that are not regenerated by the grace of the Spirit of God, euen to Pagans and infidels. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then, by the confession of our aduersaries, men that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obey this commandement which is giuen vnto them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue not the grace of God, without the which we can do no good, that tendeth to saluation.</p>
                     <p>That which maketh our aduersaries to combat one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and not to vnderstand themselues, is a false presupposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which they make, that man by his free will can do all that which God commandeth: which is a maxime that we must banish out of Diuinitie; for God in the Gospell com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth vs to haue faith in Iesus Christ; and neuerthelesse Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Ephes. 2.8. saith, <hi>This faith cometh not from our selues, but it is a gift of God.</hi> God by his Prophet, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 18.31. <hi>commandeth vs to make vs new hearts:</hi> but he himselfe by the same Prophet, 36.2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. declareth, that it is he that giueth a new heart, and a new spirit, that taketh away the heart of stone, and giueth a heart of flesh.</p>
                     <p>God in his Law speaketh to all men, for the Law is our
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:11462:59"/> naturall debt: and yet it is a thing granted by all men, that without being instructed in the word of God, it is impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to accomplish it; &amp; there are an infinite number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to whom the word of God is not preached, who neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse are bound to accomplish the Law.</p>
                     <p>This proofe is demonstratiue, that if by our free will we cannot dispose of the grace without the which we cannot obey God, nor do that good which serueth to saluation, that also by this free will we cannot obey God, nor do that good which serueth to saluation. Then let <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> learne, that the Law of God is not a proofe of our ability, but of our duty; and that he which asketh a man that which he oweth him, is not vniust, although the debtor be become vnable by his owne fault. And if the debtor be become poore by his owne prodigalitie, yet thereby he is not lesse bound to pay: and the creditor that will be payd, considers him not as rich or poore, but as a debtor. So it is in this case, for God had crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man righteous, and by his free will able to chuse good or euill: by his owne fall he hath lost this righteousnesse,<note place="margin">Aug.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:11462:60"/> that thy benefit should not be as it were of necessitie, but as willingly. Note this last</hi> as, <hi>to be added for the pleasure of the Ministers.

                  <p>All these words tend to shew, that all those that are bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, haue no more originall sinne, and by consequence haue no more actuall sinne, for all our wicked actions proceed from our corrupt nature.</p>
                  <p>This matter is of great importance. For the knowledge of the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ruption of our nature, maketh vs know the necessitie of the grace of God. If we did not know what euill it is to be borne in <hi>Adam,</hi> we should not know what good it is to be borne againe in Iesus Christ. We must necessarily know the miserie of our naturall generation, before we proceed to our spirituall regeneration.</p>
                  <p>This naturall corruption is called originall sinne, because we haue it from our birth. This sinne is an hereditary euill, which consisteth in the depriuation of originall righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and in an inclination to euill. This corruption is fallen vpon man by propagation, and is come vpon vs from our first father, whose transgression is imputed to all mankinde,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:11462:61"/> because <hi>Adam</hi> did not sinne as a particular man, but as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting all humane kind, both in his beginning and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall. The benefits which he had receiued for himselfe and his posteritie, he lost for himselfe and his posterity. The crime of treason commited by the father, disparageth also his posteritie. And by all humane lawes, children are charged with their fathers debts. But herein there is a difference, that for debts children may renounce their patrimonie but men can not renounce this hereditary corruption, because origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall sin is not onely a debt, but also an hereditarie contagion &amp; disease: as when a leprosie seizeth vpon a whole generation.</p>
                  <p>Circumcision in the old Testament, and Baptisme in the new Testament, are silent confessions of originall sinne: for by these sacraments conferred to little children, the Church confesseth, that there is some superfluous thing in them to cut off, and that they are come into the world with spots and filthinesse, the which they desire to haue washed away by the grace of God in Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>Because of this originall sinne, children are subiect to die, although they haue not actually sinned: euen as we breake the egges of Aspes, although they neuer bit nor infected any man, because that out of them there would come venimous serpents; so a child dieth iustly, although it hath not actually sinned: but it is sufficient that his nature is vicious, and will one day disclose and bring forth sinne, which is there alreadie in power, and in his originall. For originall sinne is the ground of all actuall sinnes: that is it which maketh man by nature incapable to obey the law of God. <hi>Dauid</hi> confesseth that he was conceiued in that sinne, Psalme 51. And our aduersaries confesse, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, that that sinne remained in him, Rom. 7.17. With this corruption not onely the children of pagans and infidels, but also the children of the faithfull and true Christians are borne: because they beget children not as they are faithfull, but in that they are men. Pietie is not hereditarie, it comes not by nature but by grace: it is not generation but regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that makes the faithfull. So vnder the law, a circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:11462:62"/> man begat a child with the foreskin: in the same maner that a graine of corne which is cleane, bringeth forth other corne with the huske and straw. If any man hath vicious chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he ought in them to acknowledge his owne nature; if he hath wise and vertuous children, he ought in them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the workes of God. That is it which Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth vs, 1. cha. 13. where he saith, <hi>That those that beleeue in Iesus Christ, are not borne of bloud, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>God furnisheth his elect with a double remedy or helpe against this originall sinne; The one, the remission of all our sins by Iesus Christ; the other the regeneration &amp; interior re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing by the holy Ghost: which changing is another birth, and a conformation of a new man, made according to the image of the Sonne of God. Of these two benefits Baptisme is a seale, by the which the benefit of Iesus Christ is applied vnto vs: as Saint <hi>Marke</hi> in the beginning of his Gospel tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, where he saith, <hi>Saint Iohn preached the baptisme of repentance, by remission of sinnes.</hi> Ioyning these two benefits to baptisme, that is, repentance, which is regeneration, with the remission of sinnes.</p>
                  <p>Whereupon we are at difference with the church of Rome: In this, that she saith, that children that are baptized haue no more original sinne, and that Baptisme wholly abolisheth that sinne. We on the contrary say, that children that are baptized, are yet spotted with that sinne, but that God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth it not, but pardoneth it for Iesus Christs sake; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the benefit is applied vnto vs by Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>Our doctrine is grounded vpon the holy Scripture, vpon the nature of God, vpon experience, and vpon the confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the aduersaries.</p>

It is to no purpose to produce examples, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to proue that this word <hi>Sinne</hi> is taken figuratiuely, either for sacrifice, or for occasion of sinne; for to this sinne where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Apostle speaketh in the seauenth chapter, things are attributed which properly belong vnto sinne, that is, to be condemned in the Law, to do euill, to dwell in man, and to fight and striue against the Lawe of God which is in the minde.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 In the third chapter of the same Epistle, verses 9. and 10. the same Apostle maintaineth, that all, both Iewes and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles are vnder sinne, as it is written, There is none righteous, no not one. Now the Iewes were circumcised, and many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles were baptized.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Therefore the same Apostle, Colossians chapter 2. verse 13. saith well, that <hi>God freely pardoneth all our offences:</hi> but saith not, that in this life God maketh vs perfectly righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and without sinne. And Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> chapter 1. verses 7. 8. of his first Epistle, after he had said, that <hi>The blood of Iesus Christ cleanseth vs from all sinne:</hi> lest that any man thereby should presume to be without sinne, he addeth, <hi>If we say that we haue no sinne, we deceiue our selues, and truth is not in vs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5 The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Romans, cha. 6. verse 23.
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:11462:63"/> saith, that <hi>The wages of sinne is death.</hi> Then the death of a man, is a certaine proofe that he is spotted and defiled with sinne. Now diuers little children die after they are baptized, before they haue committed any actuall sinne: then necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily they are spotted with sinne; which sinne consequently, must be originall sinne, seeing they haue not yet done any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall sinne.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 In the twelfth verse of the same chapter he saith, <hi>Let not sin therefore reigne in your mortall bodies, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof.</hi> These words are a silent confession that sinne dwelleth in vs, and an exhortation to hinder it from hauing the vpper hand, and that dwelling in vs, as it is said in the chapter following, it should not reigne in vs,</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Experience also proueth it. For if fathers and mothers that are baptized, haue no originall sinne, how comes it then that children are borne in originall sinne? How can fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers giue that to their children which they haue not?</p>
                  <p n="8">8 Likewise, do we not ordinarily see little children, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are baptized, to be peruerse and vncorrigible? They are all naturally inclined to lie. We see a peruerse humour in them. The loue and the reuerence which they beare to their babies, are euident seeds of Idolatrie. From whence should this peruersity enter into them, but onely by their corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, because they could not haue learned it by example?</p>
                  <p n="9">9 Whosoeuer taketh away a cause which can onely produce an effect, taketh away the effect also. Now, naturall corruption, which is originall ūnne, is the cause of all euill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions. Then that being taken away, by consequence also all euil actions are taken away. But seeing that after baptisme euill actions appeare, it is certaine, that originall sinne is not abolished.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 If a man that is baptized becometh prophane and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious, hath he not originall sinne? hath he not that corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and inclination to euill, that he brought into the world? If he hath it, how is it come againe, after he lost it in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme? If he hath it not, how is he so much inclined to euill?</p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:11462:63"/>
                  <p n="11">11 I leaue a great number of places in the holy Scriptures, which condemne all men, euen the most righteous, to be sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and summon the most perfect that are in the church of Rome, to the testimony of their owne consciences. For who is he among them, that is not oftentimes moued with pride and choler, and infected with euill desires? What is he that loueth his God with all his heart, and his neighbour as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe?

This concupiscence is sinne; for that Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Romans chapter 7. and verse 7. calleth it sinne, hauing learned that of the law which saith, <hi>Thou shalt not couet.</hi> For Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle, third chapter, and fourth verse saith, <hi>Sinne is the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of the Law.</hi> To thinke to deceiue or mocke the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, &amp; such expresse words of the Apostle by a distinction forged in Schooles, is to leaue nothing certaine in the word of God. Our Aduersaries say that concupiscence is sinne, when it hath a resolute desire or will to offend God, but if it be but motions without resolution, and without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, that it is no sinne. Remembring not, that when they say so, they contradict themselues, and iniure Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle. For our aduersaries confesse, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, that this concupiscence which he calleth Sin, remained in him. Now would they say, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had a determinate will to sinne, or that he tooke pleasure to offend God?</p>
                  <p n="13">13 Moreouer God commandeth vs to loue and serue him with all our hearts, and by consequence forbiddeth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigations and motions of euill desires, which cannot be when the heart is wholly possessed with the Spirit of God. Neither Iesus Christ, nor the blessed Saints in heauen haue those concupiscences.</p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:11462:64"/>
                  <p n="14">14 Reason also is therin most manifest, for he is put to death that hath neuer so little spoken and conspired with the enemy to betray a towne, although he hath not proceeded to a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute will to execute that treason. And a maide that giueth care vnto vnchast temptations, maketh a breach in her credit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though she hath not proceeded to a full resolution to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill. Yet these men affirme, that concupiscence which temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and soliciteth man to offend God, is no sinne, so that the will consent not thereunto, and that men proceed not to a full resolution. If the will did holily to resist concupiscence, concupiscence did wickedly to tempt and solicite the will.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 Behold the Apostle, who (by our aduersaries confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) speaking of this concupiscence, saith, that by it he doth the euill that he would not. Rom. 7.19. and that it fighteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the law of his minde, verse 23. that is, against the law of God printed in his minde. How then dare they say, that to do euill is no sinne? and that to resist against the Law of God and to striue against it, is no offence to God?</p>
                  <p n="16">16 If concupiscence without resolute will is no sinne after baptisme, much lesse then is it sinne in children before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, when man is wholly without actuall vse of his will.</p>
                  <p n="17">17 To this euill, the question is to finde a remedie: which remedie ought not to be forged in our owne braines, but to be found in the word of God, wherein we finde these two remedies.<note place="margin">Coloss. 2.13. Acts 10.43. 1. Ioh. 1.7.</note> The one, that all our sinnes are pardoned by Iesus Christ, and by consequence originall sinne. The other, that God regenerateth vs by his holy Spirit, to cause sinne to reigne no more in vs, touching our hearts with repentance. Of these two benefits baptisme is a Sacrament. Thus, <hi>Iohn bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized the baptisme of repentance for remission of sinnes,</hi> Marke. 1.4: but that originall sinne should be abolished by baptisme, the word of God saith not so. It is an opinion contradicted by the word of God, and by experience.</p>
                  <p n="18">18 By that <hi>M.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:11462:64"/> doth not truly regenerate vs: which is to make vs say the contrary vnto that which we beleeue. By the full remission of sinnes applied in baptisme, God draweth vs from death; and by the Spirit of regeneration he beginneth life in vs: which is not perfected all at once, but goeth forward by degrees; which doth not hinder vs from being acceptable vnto God, nor that he should not acknowledge vs for his adopted and redeemed children in Iesus Christ.</p>

                     <p>To know the truth of our beleefe, we need but take the contrary to that which <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> attributeth vnto vs: for he is sworne neuer to report the truth of our beleefe.</p>
                     <p>Then to set downe the truth of our doctrine, and the point of the difference: we say, that by the obedience which Iesus Christ yeelded to his Father, we are made righteous, and that the righteousnesse of Iesus Christ is ours, because it is impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and allowed vnto those that beleeue in Iesus Christ. On the contrary, the Church of Rome saith, that man is iustified by his owne workes. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the first booke of Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, cap. 2. saith, that the forme of iustification is charitie. And in truth this word, <hi>iustification,</hi> among our aduersaries, is taken for regeneration or sanctification, and for the studie of good workes. And therefore the Councell of Trent in the sixt Session, setteth downe diuers increasings and degrees of Iustification.</p>
                     <p>In this matter we agree with our aduersaries in two things:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:11462:68"/> The first, that good workes are necessarie to saluation, and that God acknowledgeth not those men to be iust, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue and take a pleasure in doing euill. The second is, that the question is not, touching that iustice whereby we are iustified before men, but of that whereby God acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vs to be iust, and by the vertue whereof we may stand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him at the day of Iudgement.</p>
                     <p>The word of God teacheth vs, that this righteousnesse which iustifieth vs before God, is the righteousnesse of Iesus Christ, whereby he hath satisfied for vs, yeelding himselfe culpable, to the end that we might be absolued; lading him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe with our sinnes, to the end that his righteousnesse and obedience might be imputed, allowed, and reckoned vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2. Cor. 5.21. saith, <hi>God hath made him to be sinne for vs, which knew no sinne; that we should be made the righteousnesse of God through him.</hi> And, Romans 5.19. <hi>By the obedience of one man, many are made righteous:</hi> and in the 18. verse, he teacheth, that the righteousnesse of Iesus Christ iustifieth vs, saying, that <hi>The iustifying of one doth iustifie vs.</hi> If by iustifying, we must here vnderstand sanctifying, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generating, the Apostle would haue attributed this iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the Spirit of God, and not to the obedience of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, which iustifieth vs, because that by it we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, and acknowledged to be righteous before God, as if we our selues had accomplished this righteousnesse. For see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that our Aduersaries confesse, that our sinnes haue beene imputed to Iesus Christ, why do they finde it strange, that the righteousnesse of Iesus Christ should be imputed vnto vs, seeing our sinnes were imputed vnto Iesus Christ, to no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end, but that his righteousnesse should be imput<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The same Apostle, Romans 4.6. saith, that <hi>God imputeth righteousnesse without workes:</hi> speaking of <hi>Abraham</hi> alreadie regenerated, to whom (he saith) that faith was imputed for righteousnesse. Then <hi>Abraham</hi> was iustified, not by the workes of regeneration, but by another righteousnes which is imputed vnto him Now, what this righteousnesse is, hee himselfe declares afterward in the eighteenth and nineteenth verses of the chapter following, where he speaketh of <hi>one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie iustifying,</hi> and saith, that <hi>By the obedience of one, many shall be made righteous.</hi> Where he speaketh of the obedience of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</p>
                     <p>The same Apostle in Rom. 4.5. saith, that <hi>Faith is counted for righteousnesse.</hi> Whereupon I aske, which of these two, (to speake properly) is imputed vnto vs for righteousnesse, whether faith in Iesus Christ, inasmuch as it is inherent in vs, or the righteousnesse of Iesus Christ apprehended by faith. It is certaine, that faith, forasmuch as it is a vertue inherent in vs, cannot be imputed vnto vs: for our vertues and our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are not imputed vnto vs, but another mans, when they are allowed and reckoned vnto vs, as if we had done them. As also, that to beleeue, (of its owne nature) is not a righteousnesse: much lesse to beleeue according to the faith of the Romish church; which is, but to beleeue that all that which God hath said, is true; which is a beleefe that the diuels haue, and more certainly then men. It resteth then, that faith is imputed vnto vs for righteousnesse, because it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth and layeth hold vpon the righteousnesse and the benefit of Iesus Christ, by the which we are iustified, that is, absolued and quit before the iudgement seate of God. And so faith iustifieth, in the same manner, that the mouth feedeth
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:11462:69"/> man, because it taketh and receiueth in the meate, but to speake properly, it is the meate which nourisheth.</p>
                     <p>For these causes the Prophet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> in the twenty three chapter and verse the sixt, calleth our Sauiour, <hi>The Lord our righteousnesse.</hi> And the Apostle to the Philippians, chapter 3. verse 9. <hi>will be found in him</hi> (that is Iesus Christ) <hi>not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing</hi> (saith he) <hi>mine owne righteousnesse which is of the Law, but that which is through the faith of Iesus Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For also, when we shall appeare before the iudgement seate of God, by the vertue of our righteousnesse to obtaine eternall life, what shall we present vnto God?

Then we must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto him a perfect righteousnesse, which is able to hold the examination of the iustice of God.

                        </note>So <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> said, aboue fourteen hundred years past, in an Epistle to <hi>Diognetus,</hi> What other thing could couer our sinnes but the righteousnesse of Christ? In whom can we that are impious and wicked be iustified, but in the onely Sonne of God? O sweet exchange! O incomparable art! O benefites surmounting all expectatiō, that the iniquity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny should be hidden in one righteous man, &amp; that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes of one, should make many to be reputed righteous!</p>
                     <p>In this the truth is so strong, that <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> after hee had tried all wayes, at the last yeelded vnto vs; for behold his words in the 7. chapter and 2. booke of Iustification: <hi>If the heretikes would onely haue, that the merites of Iesus Christ should be imputed vnto vs, because they are giuen vnto vs, and we may offer them to God the Father for our sins, because Christ hath taken on him the burthen to satisfie for vs, and to reconcile vs to God his father, their opinion should be true and right.</hi> We say no
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:11462:69"/> other thing, and this simply is our beleefe. And in the tenth chapter, after he hath said that Christ is our righteousnesse, because he hath satisfied for vs, he addeth; <hi>In this manner it should not be an absurditie, if any man should say, that the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse and the merites of Christ are imputed vnto vs, because they are giuen and applyed vnto vs, as if we our selues had satisfied vnto God.</hi> Then let vs hold there; for we say nothing more. By this meanes God shall not be deceiued, as <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> saith; and our righteousnesse shall be much more assured then if it were grounded vpon our owne workes: and yet God will not leaue to regenerate and sanctifie vs inwardly, and frame vs to good workes. As God was not deceiued when he imputed our sinnes to Iesus Christ, so he is not deceiued when he imputeth the righteousnesse of Iesus Christ vnto vs. There is neither iniustice nor ignorance committed, to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a prisoner that lieth in prison for debt, when another man hath payd it for him. For, as the sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> was imputed to his posteritie, because he represented all humane kinde, as the beginning of them; so the righteousnesse of Iesus Christ is imputed to all the faithfull, because that by accomplishing all righteousnesse, he represented all the Church, as the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning thereof. And the righteousnesse of Iesus Christ is imputed vnto the faithfull by greater reason then the sinne of <hi>Adam</hi> is imputed vnto other men, because <hi>Adam</hi> did not vndertake for others to obey God:<note place="margin">Galat. 3.13. and cap. 4.4.5</note> but Iesus Christ volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily subiected himselfe to the Law, to deliuer vs from the curse of the Law.</p>

Our Confession saith, that by the onely Sacrifice which Iesus Christ offered vpon the crosse, we are reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to God. For proofe thereof, the first Epistle and second chapter and twenty fourth verse of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> is quoted in the margent; <hi>Christ bare our sinnes in his body, on the tree: that we being dead to sinne, should liue in righteousnesse, by whose stripes ye were healed.</hi> Can there be a stronger, or a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse place alledged, to proue, that Iesus Christ by his death vpon the crosse hath reconciled vs vnto God? for that is the bearing of our sinnes in his body, and to heale vs. But it pleaseth <hi>M.

                     <p>And yet this place proues not, that we are already wholly dead to sinne, nor that we are exempted from sinne.

But <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> will perswade vs, that he is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely righteous, and that sinne liueth no more in him. And yet neuerthelesse, he goes to the Iubilie to get pardons; and when he is confessed, he receiueth absolution. When he saith his <hi>Pater noster,</hi> he saith, Forgiue vs our trespasses; he belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to go to Purgatorie, and makes profession to doubt of his saluation.

                     <p>Our Confession saith that Iesus Christ is the only purgation
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:11462:71"/> of our sinnes, and that his death is a full and a perfect satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the same: which we ground vpon the word of God, which saith, Apocalips 1.5. That <hi>Iesus Christ hath washed vs from our sinnes in his owne bloud.</hi> 1. Ioh. 1.7. <hi>The bloud of Iesus Christ cleanseth vs from all sinne:</hi> Colos. 2.13. <hi>By him God freely forgiueth all our trespasses.</hi> Acts 4.12. <hi>There is no other name vnder heauen whereby we must be saued.</hi> Colos. 1.19.20. <hi>For it pleased the Father, that in him should all fulnesse dwell, and hauing made peace through the bloud of the crosse by him to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile all things vnto himselfe, both which are in earth, and which are in heauen.</hi> 1. Iohn 2.2. <hi>He is the reconciliation for our sinnes, and not for ours onely, but also for the sinnes of the whole world.</hi> Heb. 10.14. <hi>For by one offering he hath perfected for euer them that are sanctified.</hi> Heb. 7.25. <hi>He is able also perfectly to saue them that come vnto God by him.</hi> Rom. 3.24. <hi>We are iustified free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by his grace through the redemption that is in Iesus Christ.</hi> And to conclude, it is the whole scope of the Gospell.</p>
                     <p>This so holy, so euident and so true a doctrine, full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation, displeaseth <hi>M. Arnoux:</hi> he saith it abolisheth our satisfactions, quencheth the spirit of penitence, and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our soules in the gulph of presumption.</p>
                     <p>Touching mens satisfactions, we say briefly, that if the word <hi>Satisfaction</hi> were taken in that sence which the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Fathers tooke it, that is, for humiliation and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our faults, there should be no disputation betweene vs. But at this day, satisfaction signifieth a payment of debts, and a recompence which man maketh to God to satisfie his iustice. The Catechisme of the Councell of Trent, saith, that satisfaction is an entire payment of that thing which is due,<note place="margin">Cap. de Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae. Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factio est rei debitae inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grasolutio: est compensatio cum homo pro peccatis com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missis Deo ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid persoluit.</note> and a recompence which man maketh vnto God for his sins: as when a man punisheth himselfe (as <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> saith) by fasting, whipping, pilgrimages, and giuing something to the Church, and when God torments him in purgatory. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall <hi>Bellarmines</hi> words are remarkable vpon this point, in the first booke of Indulgences, cap. 4. If a righteous man (saith he) by his works may by equiualence merit life euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting, why can he not satisfie for temporall paine, which is
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:11462:72"/> a lesse thing? And in the second chapter of the same booke he saith, The remission of the paine is due to the satisfying work, by commutatiue iustice: which is a iustice that payeth so much for so much, or a bartering iustice, in such manner that God ought to be content therewith. By this reckning, God should do contrarie to iustice, if he should not accept for good payment, the satisfying paines wherewith a sinner punisheth himselfe. And in the 10. chap. of the first booke of Purgatorie; It seemeth (saith he) more probable, that in effect there is but one satisfaction, which is ours. Touching that of Iesus Christ, he will haue it to serue onely to make ours auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Nay the pride of the Romane Church is so great, that in it they hold that a man can make more satisfaction vnto God then he ought to do, so that there is something remaining to be allowed to the sinner ouer and aboue: that is it which they call superabundant satisfaction, which is the monasticall life.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 As for vs, seeing that in Iesus Christ we haue a full sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for all our sinnes, we are content therewith, and take not vpon vs by our owne sufferings to pay a debt which Iesus Christ hath wholly satisfied.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Also we do not beleeue that Iesus Christ died to make our sufferings of any worth before God, but to free and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt vs from suffering. For the benefite of Iesus Christs suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring consisteth not herein, to make vs pay, but to pay and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for vs vnto God. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1. to Tim. 2.6. saith, that <hi>Iesus Christ gaue himselfe for a ransome for vs.</hi> But he saith not, that he gaue vs the vertue to pay our owne ransome. And the Apostle, Hebr. 1.3. saith, that <hi>The Sonne of God hath by himselfe purged our sinnes.</hi> Then not by our satisfactions.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 That if it be an honour which God doth vnto vs, by our sufferings to make our owne satisfaction, (as the Papists al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) &amp; that if our satisfying paines and punishments are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the graces of God, the diuels and the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned shall haue more part in those graces then we; seeing God doth them that honour, to make them to pay by continuall torments, and draweth full satisfaction from them.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 God forbid that we should beleeue, that God takes
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:11462:72"/> payment twise for one debt, when the first payment is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. Will God that is soueraignly iust, (after he hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned all our offences,) punish those sinnes that he hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, with satisfying paines?</p>
                     <p n="5">5 And seeing that the Church of Rome beleeueth, that by the death of Iesus Christ all our guiltinesse is taken away, will God punish men without fault in a burning fire? The cause (which onely produceth an effect) being taken away, by necessitie the effect ceasseth. Now the fault is the cause which onely produceth the satisfying punishment. Therefore the fault being taken away, necessarily satisfying punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is taken away:<note place="margin">Exempto rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu remittitur &amp; poena.</note> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith in his booke of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme cap. 5. The fault being taken away, the paine also is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Besides, God is no mocker: but he should manifestly mocke vs, if he should say, I will forgiue thee, but yet I will punish thee. I forgiue thee thy debt, but thou shalt pay me. For our sinnes are debts, the payment whereof is the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 It is not credible, that God would haue vs to be more mercifull then himselfe. But he will haue vs wholly to forgiue him that hath offended vs: he permitteth not vs to take any vengeance or reuenge, after we haue forgiuen him. For what is forgiuenesse but not to punish? Then if God forgiueth the sin, &amp; not the punishment of the sin, the way is made open to fraudulent reconciliations: &amp; he that shall haue pardoned an iniury will in his heart receiue a punishment for the same. For he wil say: Will you haue me to be more mercifull then God? herein I haue followed his example. We are too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to vice, without seeking to proue that God incites vs thereunto by his example.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 I would haue them to shew me, how and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner Iesus Christ bore our offences.<note place="margin">Suscipiendo poenam, &amp; nō suscipiendo culpam, &amp; cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam deleuit &amp; poenam.</note> Was it not by suffering the punishment due to them? And if he endured the punishment, was it not to exempt vs from it? This is it which S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith in his 27. Sermon of the words of the Lord. Christ taking vpon him the punishment and not the fault, hath abolished
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:11462:73"/> both the fault and the punishment.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 It also appeareth, how foolish this doctrine is, that the fault should be remitted and not the punishment, by this, that there is no criminall person but would be very well content that the king should not pardon his offence, so that he would wholly remit the paine and punishment thereof, and not suffer him to endure any punishment at all.</p>

                        </gap> by our owne suffering we must satisfie and appease the wrath of god, when shall we haue satisfyed for the least part of our sinnes? seeing that by the iudgement of the Sonne of God Mat. 5.12, to call our brother foole is a fault punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with hell fier: &amp; that S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Cor. 6, saith, that <hi>euill spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers shall not inherite the kingdome of God.</hi> And yet these are sinnes from which the most righteous men can hardly cleare themselues.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 Adde hereunto, that by this doctrine the afflictions of the faithfull are bitter, and their finger is dipt in gall. For the faithfull which beleeueth that God punisheth him for his good, and that it is a great punishment not to be chastised, is easily comforted in his afflictions, which he receiueth as spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual remedies. The maladies of the body, are vnto him me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines of the soule. Pouertie to him is a diet, and a discipline of abstinence. Banishment an abandoning of the world, &amp; an admonition that he is a stranger vpon earth. And if they be afflictions for the Gospel, he glorieth therein, as in honorable wounds and badges of our warfare, and conformitie to the crosse of Christ. But where shall the faithfull finde comfort and consolation in their euils, if they must beleeue that God punisheth them to satisfy his iustice? and that their sufferings are satisfactions vnto him? Therein they haue no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation then Pagans haue, which is, to giue place to necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and to arme our selues with hardnesse against blowes, with a kind of patience without comfort.</p>
                     <p n="12">12 Then when these satisfactions shall be well weighed, they will be found very light: and it will appeare, that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists would pay the iustice of God with base money; whose satisfactions are, to abstaine from flesh certaine dayes, to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:11462:73"/> go on pilgrimage, and so to leade an idle life; to gird their bodies with cords, to enter into the Order of any Friers, to whip themselues openly, as the penitents in Rome vse to do in the weeke before Easter, some for their owne sinnes, others being hired, whipping themselues for other mens sins: some also for loue, and to satisfie God for the sinnes of their mistresses. Thus you see wherewith they would haue God sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied and contented for their sinnes, for they esteeme it to be an easie composition. To ioyne these things with the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite satisfactions of the Sonne of God, is as if one should few beggers rags to a kings robe.</p>
                     <p n="13">13 Certainly these people with their penall workes, whipping, and voluntarie torments, seeme to men to speake vnto God, and say, I will satisfie thee. Thou wilt wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit my sinne, but I will not be so much beholden vnto thee. Then it is great reason that they should pay to the full: and if hereupon by a Capuchins penitence, or by a proud humilitie they cut and mangle their flesh, I trow they haue well deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it. And seeing that to satisfie God they are obstinately bent to be burnt after this life in so long and burning a fier, it is reason that they should soake in fire, and that sentence which they alledge of Christ should be practised vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, Mat. 5.26. <hi>Ʋerily I say vnto thee, thou shalt not come out thence, till thou hast payd the vtmost farthing.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14 But at the day of iudgement, when they must yeeld an account of their actions, and that their sinnes shall be laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen before them what shall be their excuse? They will say, Lord it is true, I haue committed such and such sinnes, but I haue satisfied for them; for I whipt my selfe, I abstained from eating of flesh for so many dayes, I went on pilgrimage, I was one of the order of Gray friers. But here I am afraid, that things being put into the ballance of Gods Iustice, they will be found too light by many graines, &amp; that the same which they giue for satisfaction, would rather be found to be a sinne; seeing they are things which God neuer required at their hands. I am afraid, that these satisfiers will be found culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, not onely for seeking to pay God with false money, but
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:11462:74"/> also finding out another satisfaction, then that of the Sonne in whom the Father is well pleased,<note place="margin">Math. 17.5. 1. Ioh. 1.7.</note> and whose bloud clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth vs from all our sinnes.</p>
                     <p n="15">15 But among the satisfying paines, there is one kind that to me seemes to be full of impietie. The Church of Rome placeth prayers and almes among penall works and satisfying paines. What a religion is this, that placeth good workes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong sufferings for sinnes? which on the contrarie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> if they should be prohibited to a man fearing God, it would be an vnsufferable punishment vnto him And by this meanes they will haue men to serue God by punishment. By this meanes good workes are made odious, and the exercise of pietie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a punishment. Neuerthelesse they haue some reason to put prayers (such as they make) among penances; for, to be condemned to repeate one prayer fiftie times one after the other, in an vnknowne language, and euery day to say his seuen Psalmes of mercy, without vnderstanding them, byting their fingers because of the tediousnesse thereof, me thinkes it is a great punishment.</p>
                     <p n="16">16 Superstitious ignorance hauing fowne the seeds of this abuse, the auarice &amp; ambition of Priests hath nourished them: for there is nothing but they will do it for gaine. Who being very sensible in the belly, are much moued when men touch theit profits, and seeke to shorten their commons. For these sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactions are very fruitfull vnto them, seeing that Purgatory is so beneficiall vnto them, &amp; that by the satisfactions which Priests impose vpon men, they take authority to inflict corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall punishments vpon sinners, which by the order of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church may be changed into pecuniarie punishments. And that by the same meanes, the Popes haue bene so bold to punish kings, and make them to endure blowes with a whip; as <hi>Alexander</hi> the third did to <hi>Henry</hi> the second King of England, and as of late <hi>Clement</hi> the eight did to our great King <hi>Henrie</hi> the fourth in the person of the Bishop of Eureux his embassador; to whom falling downe at his feete the Pope caused certaine blowes with a staffe to be giuen, for a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third imposed vpon <hi>Iohn</hi> King
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:11462:74"/> of England for satisfaction, that he should resigne his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome vnto him, and make his Crowne and Realme tributary to the Pope.</p>
                     <p n="17">17 Iesus Christ did not so, for in the eight of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> hauing pardoned the woman taken in adulterie, he imposed no satisfiing paine vpon her, but onely said vnto her <hi>Go, and sinne no more.</hi> The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul:</hi> 2. Cor. 2. saith, that he had pardoned the incestuous person to whom neuerthelesse inioyned no penance after the pardon.</p>
                     <p n="18">18 If these satisfactions be euill, why do they enioyne them? If they be good, why do they dispence with them by Indulgences? why do they hinder the sinner from making be satisfaction vnto God?</p>
                     <p>The abuse being thus discouered, they runne for aide, and seeke to support their ruinous cause with reeds.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 They alledge the counsell that Daniell, 4.27. gaue to <hi>Nabucadnezzer, Redeeme thy sinnes by righteousnesse, and thine iniquitie by shewing mercy to the poore.</hi> But they are deceiued to thinke, that <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh of sinnes before God: for he speaketh of redeeming and satisfying before men whom the king had wronged, whom he ought to recompence by libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie. Adde hereunto that almes are good workes, and not punishments nor penances. And which is more our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries will haue almes and other satisfactions, not to satisfie for sinnes, but for the punishments due to sinnes. The chiefe point is, that the Chuch of Rome holdeth, that satisfactions serue onely to satisfie for the temporall punishment, and not for the eternall: and that they serue for nothing before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, no more then they did in time past before circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. Now this king was a pagan vncircumcized, and ought rather to thinke vpon sauing himselfe from eternall paines. For satisfactions of Purgatorie are of no value nor worth vnto them that go into hell. To go about to satisfie for tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall punishment, when a man is bound to eternall punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is all one, as for a man to set vp a weathercocke before he hath laid tht foundation of the building.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 They say, that the benefit of Iesus Christ ought to be
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:11462:75"/> applied vnto vs, and that it is applied vnto vs, by satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie punishment, and by the torments of Purgatorie; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I answer, that they say it without proofe, and without testimony of the holy Scriptures. It belongs to the word of God to prescribe vs the meanes to apply vnto our selues the benefit of our Redeemer, and not to vs to guesse at it. Adde hereunto, that none can applie any thing by his contrary, as these Doctors do, that will haue God to apply the remission of our debts, by making vs pay them, and the pardon in Iesus Christ by the punishment, as if a man should apply a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine by poyson. Certainely, to apply the grace of God to a man, by rosting him in a fire, is a strange kinde of applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The benefits of our Sauiour, are applied vnto vs by faith, Ephes. 3.17. by Baptisme, Galat. 3.27. By the holy Supper of our Lord, 1. Cor. 10.18: but not by blowes with a whip, wasting of the spirits by a haire-cloth, or by a Monks coule.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 They adde, that in all the workes of God, his Iustice as well as his Mercie must appeare; but Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> 2.13. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth that, saying, <hi>There shall be condemnation mercilesse to him that sheweth not mercie.</hi> Then let vs say the like, that there shall be mercie without iudgement to him that shall shew mercie. And as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, Rom. 8.1: There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Christ Iesus. If none, then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eternall nor temporall, and yet the iustice of God hath euidently bene displayed against the sinnes of the children of God, by punishing them in Iesus Christ, who bare the punishment; and his mercie shewed by freely imputing that satisfaction vnto vs.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 They also say, that after the King hath pardoned an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, yet the partie offended is to be agreed withall. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that that falls out so, because the King and the partie are two; but here God which is the King, is also the partie: who hauing remitted al that belongs to him, there is no more parties to content.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Their reason is no better, when they say, that the King hauing granted an offender his life, neuerthelesse condemnes him to pay a great fine. For in that case (say they) the pardon
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:11462:75"/> which the King giueth, is not a full pardon, but a diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the punishment. But Gods pardon is full and entire, Coloss. 2.13 <hi>God freely forgiueth all our offences.</hi> And 1.<note place="margin">

                     <p n="6">6 They also set downe experience for a proofe: for they say, that after God hath pardoned vs, he ceasseth not to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish vs. So <hi>Dauid</hi> was punished by God after he had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him, by the Prophet <hi>Nathan,</hi> that he had forgiuen his offence, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.13. And from thence Cardinall <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> in the tenth chapter of his first booke of Purgatorie inferreth, That Iesus Christ hath not fully satisfied for all the punishments of our sinnes.<note n="*" place="margin">Si Christus satisfecit pro omni culpa &amp; poena nostra, cur post re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missam cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pam adhuc tam multa mala pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur?</note> If (saith he) Christ hath satisfied for all our faults, and for all our punishments, why do we yet suffer so many euils after the fault is remitted? This Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late wrongs the Sonne of God, denying that his death is our full payment. But to answer to this obiection, I say it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose, for the question is of satisfactory pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments: but the punishments suffered by <hi>Dauid</hi> were cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stisements; the one, are punishments of a Iudge, the other, the corrections of a father. The one serueth to make satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to him that is offended, and to the iustice of the Iudge; the other to correct our vnrighteousnesse, and to amend a sinner. The chastisements wherewith God visiteth his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are benefits, and are spirituall medicines: they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercises and not payments. Medicines are not satisfactions. A good father correcteth his children to make them better, and not to content himselfe, and to satisfie his iustice. If our Aduersaries would, with vs, beleeue that God punisheth not his children, but with punishments of amendment and father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chastisements, Purgatorie would soone fall, where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment hath no place. For they will haue Purgatorie to be a vengeance which God taketh for faults past, and not a warning for the time to come. The death of Iesus Christ ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth to exempt vs from satisfying the iustice of God by satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorie punishments, but not to exempt vs from chastise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. For it ought not to serue to hurt vs, and to make vs incorrigible; but those whom God hath adopted in Iesus
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:11462:76"/> Christ, are those whom he chastiseth most seuerely for their instructions. So he chastened <hi>Dauid,</hi> who in supporting his fatherly corrections, neuer thought by that meanes to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the iustice of God.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 <hi>Maister Arnoux,</hi> to make vs odious, saith, that by abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing our owne satisfactions and merits, we pull the spirit of penitence out of our hearts, and drowne the soule in the bog of slothfulnesse and negligence of good workes. On the contrary, I maintaine, that there is nothing which more stirreth vp and wakeneth repentance, nor that inciteth a man more to feare God, &amp; loue him, then the memorie of our free redemption by Iesus Christ, and of our full reconciliation. The true motiue vnto pietie, is not the ambition of merites, or of paying God with our owne, nor the feare of a fire after this life, but filiall loue, kindled by the acknowledging of his loue. He that serueth God onely for feare of punishment, is moued thereunto by a seruile feare, and not by a filiall loue. God sheweth great clemencie vnto such a man, if he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisheth him not for his seruice. Therefore, the Scripture that speaketh of free pardon, and of redemption in Iesus Christ, ordinarily from thence draweth exhortations to feare God, and to liue holily. <hi>Dauid, Psal.</hi> one hundred and thirtie, and the fourth verse, saith, <hi>But there is forgiuenesse with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 12 1. exhorteth vs, by the mercies of God, to offer and consecrate our bodies vnto the Lord.<note place="margin">Tit. 2.11.12.</note> For (saith he) in another place: <hi>The grace of God that brings saluation vnto all men hath appeared, and tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs, that we should deny vngodlinesse, and worldly lusts, and that we should liue soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world.</hi> Iesus Christ hath redeemed vs, to the end that we should serue him: his benefit is not a prophane impunitie: Christian liberty is not a licence. Peace of conscience is not a carnall sluggishnesse. The Apostle saith, Iesus Christ can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deuided:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.13.</note> but it is a deuiding of him, if we will haue him for a Redeemer, and not for a Maister, and participate in his promises, reiecting his commandements 1. <hi>Peter</hi> 2.24. <hi>He bare our sinnes in his body on the tree, that we being dead to sin
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:11462:76"/> should liue vnto righteousnesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We see not in the Romish church, where humane satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions are preached, that by that means vice is diminished; for the church of Rome is the onely church in the world, where vice is become a law, and where, by publike ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, the Stewes are erected, whoredome permitted, and marriage forbidden. There is none but the Romish church, wherein by lawes &amp; decrees the people are taught to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels to their Prince, and not to keepe faith with those that are excommunicated, and where a trafficke of sacred things is publikely established.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 All this abuse is grounded vpon a most pernitious max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, which is one of the cankered vlcers of the church of Rome. This maxime is, that the punishment for sinne before Baptisme is remitted vnto vs by Baptisme; but that for the punishment of sinnes committed after Baptisme, we are to satisfie for them by penall workes and satisfactory penance, aswell in this life as in Purgatorie. A new Gospell, whereof there is not one print nor footstep in all the word of God. The Councell of Trent in the fourteenth Session, eight chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to defend this doctrine, saith, That it seemes that the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of God requireth, that those that before Baptisme haue sinned by ignorance, should be more fauourably vsed then those that haue sinned voluntarily after Baptisme. But these Fathers, by saying so, condemne themselues. For, may it not fall out, that some may sinne maliciously before Baptisme: and on the contrary, that after Baptisme they may sinne by ignorance or infirmitie? In this case what apparence is there, that God will not exact any satisfactorie punishment for sins committed of deliberate malice, and will exact them for sins committed by ignorance or infirmity? And which is more, may it not happen, that a man should cause himselfe fainedly or for gaine to be baptized, and yet in his heart is an enemy to the Name of Christ? Is it a iust thing, that hypocrisie should be auaileable vnto him, and that for mocking of God, all his sinnes committed before baptisme should be pardoned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any pennance or satisfaction?</p>

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Galat. cap. 3.27. saith, <hi>That all those that are baptized haue put on Christ.</hi> By this word <hi>put on,</hi> he sheweth vs, that the fruite of baptisme is specially for the time after baptisme, for we put on clothes for the time to come.</p>

That is to conuert the afflictions for Iesus Christ into bitternesse, and to make them intollerable, if we make them payments, satisfactions, and penances to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease and content the iustice of God: whereas they are the liueries of Christian souldiers, an honourable opprobrie and conformitie to the Sonne of God.

                     <p>Touching that which <hi>M.

Behold the meanes which it
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:11462:78"/> giueth vs to apply Iesus Christ vnto vs. First by baptisme, Galat. 3.27. <hi>For all ye that are baptized into Christ, haue put on Christ.</hi> Secondly, by the holy Supper, 1. Cor. 10.16. <hi>The bread which we brake, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?</hi> Thirdly by faith, Ephes. 3.12. <hi>By whom we haue bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and entrance with confidence, by faith in him.</hi> And this faith <hi>is by hearing of the word of God.</hi> Rom. 10.17. But to apply Iesus Christ vnto vs by suffering paines and torments in this life, or in Purgatory, the word of God speaketh not at all. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is most manifest; for we do not apply a thing by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary thereof, as the Church of Rome doth, that will haue God to apply grace and pardon of sinnes freely vnto vs by pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing vs: and that God applieth the remission of our debts vnto vs, by making vs to pay them: that is, not to apply but to cut off and drie vp this grace. Is not this a notable appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, to burne a man two or three thousand yeares in a fire? And yet to intoxicate our braines, they place this fire among the graces of God: they will haue the bloud of Iesus Christ to giue vertue to this fire to be a satisfaction. In the end we shall find by their doctrine, that the diuels are Gods minions: for God sheweth them that fauour to satisfie to the full, and by that meanes they haue this aduantage, not to be much bound vnto him.</p>

Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> purgeth vs of this slander in the third booke and sixt chapter of Iustification. The aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries (saith he) do not deny, but that faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance are requisite, that is, a liuely faith, and an earnest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance: and that without them no man can be iustified. Whosoeuer is an enemy to charitie; whosoeuer saith that good workes are not necessary to saluation: and whosoeuer thinketh to be saued by a faith without workes, let him be accursed.

                     <p>The originall of this abuse proceedeth from this, that our aduersaries know not what this word <hi>faith</hi> in the Scripture signifieth: and point and set forth vnto vs a false imagination, for the true faith; for if they could discerne and perceiue what faith is, they would behold it necessarily accompanied with vertue, and fruitfull in good workes.</p>

Touching the affiance whereby some men particularly perswade themselues that God will be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull vnto them, he saith at the end of the chapter<note n="***" place="margin">Catholici certam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missionem spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cialis miseri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiae, nō tam ad fidem quā ad praesump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt.</note> that it is rather a presumption. And to make an end of painting out of faith, he bereaueth it of knowledge: and in the seuenth chapter maintaineth:<note n="*" place="margin">Probatur fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem non esse notitiam sed assensum.</note> that faith is not a knowledge, but a consenting; and that, <hi>Fides melius per ignorantiam quàm per
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:11462:80"/> notitiam definitur:</hi> That faith is better defined by ignorance then by knowledge. For the Church of Rome will haue the people to beleeue without knowledge, and to referre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues therein to the Church, without knowing what the Church beleeueth, or what it ought to beleeue.</p>
                     <p>This is the ground of the mischiefe. For seeing that our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries by <hi>faith,</hi> vnderstand a consenting to an vnknowne doctrine, which onely beleeueth that all that which God hath said is true, without knowing what it is, and without confidence in his promise; it is no maruell that they seeke for their iustification in another thing, and not in faith: and that <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> thinketh, that to extoll faith, is to fight against charitie and the exercise of vertues. For there is nothing found in faith (as the Church of Rome defineth it) which may not be found in diuers prophane persons, yea euen in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels themselues, who beleeue that all that which God hath said is true, and consent thereunto: for faith without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is a voluntary blindnesse vnder shadow of docility. To know the promise of God, and not to beleeue it, is an iniury done vnto God, and matter of torment, and disquietnesse of conscience.</p>
                     <p>The word of God describeth faith vnto vs in a contrary manner. For Iesus Christ not onely saith, <hi>Beleeue me,</hi> but <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in me,</hi> Iohn 14.1. Now to beleeue in Iesus Christ, is to put our trust in him. And in Rom. 4.10. <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by this, that he made no doubt of the promise of God with distrust, but was strengthened in faith. And <hi>Abraham</hi> is called the father of the faithfull: that his faith may be an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample to conforme vs thereunto. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> 1.6. will haue the faithfull <hi>pray in faith, and wauer not:</hi> for that faith in prayer excludeth doubt and distrust to be heard. And in Matth. 8.26. When the disciples were afraid to be drowned, although Iesus Christ was with them in the ship, he rebuked them, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Why are ye fearefull ô ye of little faith?</hi> H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>re there was no question made of consenting, but of trusting in the aide and succour of Iesus Christ: for feare fighteth directly against confidence.</p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:11462:81"/>
                     <p>How often doth the holy Scripture attribute effects vnto faith, which cannot agree to a simple consent, without trust to the promise of God? Iesus Christ in the Gospell an hundred times at the least vrgeth, that <hi>He that beleeueth in him hath life euerlasting,</hi> Iohn 6.47. And S. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 1.17. saith, <hi>that the iust shall liue by faith.</hi> And in the fifth chapter he saith, <hi>that being iustified by faith, we haue peace towards God:</hi> making peace of conscience to spring from faith. All these things are false, if the Romish definition of faith be true: for all those which beleeue that all that which God hath said is true, haue not life eternall, for then the diuels should be saued. To yeeld a consent to the doctrine of the Gospell, and not to trust in the promise of God, procureth not peace of conscience, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther trouble and perplexitie.</p>
                     <p>Therefore Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 11.1. who will haue vs to be followers of him, bindeth vs by his example, to speake as he doth, and particularly to apply vnto our selues the promises of the Gospell, by saying as he saith, 1. Tim. 1.15. <hi>This is a true saying, and by all meanes worthy to be receiued, that Christ came into the world to saue sinners, of whom I am chiefe.</hi> By saying, <hi>This is a true saying,</hi> he cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And so Gallat. 2.20. he saith, <hi>The Sonne of God loueth me, and hath giuen himselfe for me.</hi> Otherwise that which he saith, Ephes. 3.12. that <hi>we haue boldnesse<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap> and entrance with confidence by faith in Iesus Christ,</hi> should be false. For can a man approch vnto God with confidence, if he distrusteth his promise? Thereby it appeareth that the Councell of Trent aforesaid cursed and excommunicated the Apostle, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating those that haue a particular affiance in the mercy and promise of God. The like abuse it is to make a iustifying faith without knowledge, and to haue a man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue without knowing: seeing that on the contrary, we must first haue knowledge to beleeue, that we may know what we beleeue. To haue a man to beleeue before he knoweth, is as much as to put out a mans eyes before we leade him. To be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:11462:81"/> so, is to beleeue we know not what, and onely to haue a good opinion of him that leadeth vs. But the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture doth ioyne faith with knowledge, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.8. <hi>They haue knowne surely, that I came out from thee, and haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued that thou hast sent me.</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.38. <hi>That ye may know and beleeue, that the Father is in me, and I in him.</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.69. <hi>And we beleeue and know, that thou art that Christ.</hi> For faith cometh by hearing of the word of God, Rom. 10. And we heare the word of God to know it, and to be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted therein. And knowledge is so necessary in faith, that sometimes the word <hi>Knowledge</hi> is set in the place of faith: as in <hi>Esay</hi> 53.11. whereas the Apostle ordinarily saith, that we are iustified by saith in Iesus Christ, it is there said, that <hi>He shall iustifie many, by the knowledge which they shall haue of him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Then this faith which is moued by knowledge and which entirely trusteth in the promise of God, necessarily abounds in good works: For, from the knowledge of the loue which God beareth vnto vs, proceedeth our loue towards God. And it is altogether impossible to trust in the promise of God without louing him. True faith is discerned from false, when it worketh by charitie, when it is ioyned with earnest and hearty repentance: when it is humble, and trusteth not in her owne merites, but in the promise of God in Iesus Christ, and when it kindleth zeale and the loue of God.</p>
                     <p>If <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> had vnderstood what this word <hi>Faith</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth, and what the nature of true iustifying faith is, he would neuer say, that we placing our Iustification in Faith onely, make men negligent and carelesse of good works. He should rather take heed, that vnder pretence of commending charitie, he ouerthroweth not faith: and that vnder a shadow of fearing God, he doth not reiect his grace, thinking to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite saluation by his owne righteousnesse.</p>
                     <p>As touching <hi>Caluine,</hi> which <hi>M.

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:11462:82"/> of the Elect, which can no more perish then Christ himselfe, because it is one body with him: in such manner neuerthelesse, that all the firmnesse and beatitude of the Church dependeth on Iesus Christ. This is not to equalize or compare the Church to Iesus Christ, but to say that it is ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto Iesus Christ by an inseparable band.</p>

                        </note> Because no man obserueth the Law, therefore it is said, that the faithfull ought to be iustified by faith onely. And a little after,<note n="*" place="margin">Vt sola fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>benediceren<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tur gentes in Christo.</note> To the end that by faith onely all nations should be blessed in Christ. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> in the two and twentieth Sermon vpon the Canticles, saith, Being iustified by faith onely, we shall haue peace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God.</p>
                     <p>Our Doctor wrongeth himselfe to thinke, that the works which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> excludeth, are the workes of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall Law. In the third chapter to the Romans, verse twenty seuen: The Apostle concludeth, that <hi>Man is iustified by faith without the workes of the Law:</hi> He there speakes of the morall law; by the which, in the chapter before, verse twelue, he said, that <hi>Those that shall haue sinned shall be iudged.</hi> And from thence he saith also, that <hi>The Gentiles which haue not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law,</hi> because they haue naturall impressions; which Law in the same chapter he saith the Iewes had transgressed by stealing, and by committing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, which cannot haue reference but to the moral Law. And in the fourth chapter he insisteth to proue, that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not iustified by workes. It had beene in vaine for him to proue that <hi>Abraham</hi> was not iustified by the workes of the ceremoniall Law, seeing that the ceremoniall Law was not then made, nor was not giuen vntill foure hundred yeares after.</p>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:11462:83"/>
                     <p>Touching the Epistle to the Galathians, it is manifest that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the second chapter, saying, that <hi>Man is iustified by faith, and not by the workes of the Law,</hi> excludeth from Iustification, not onely the workes of the ceremoniall, but also those of the morall Law. For in the fift chapter and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verse, he saith: <hi>For all the Law is fulfilled in one word, which is this: Thou shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe.</hi> And in the third chapter and tenth verse he saith, that Iesus Christ hath deliuered vs from the curse of the Law, euen from that Law which saith, <hi>Cursed is euery man which continueth not in all things which are written in the booke of the Law, to do them:</hi> which is a place taken out of the seuen and twentieth chapter of Deuteronomie, twenty sixt verse, where it is spoken one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the morall Law.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding we do not abolish good workes, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we exclude them from our iustification. No man can be iustified without workes, although he shall not be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by workes. Euen as the eyes are not without the eares, and yet the eyes onely see, and not the eares. For faith one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath the vertue to iustifie vs that is, to cause vs to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued and accounted iust before the iudgement seate of God, because faith onely hath this property, to apprehend the benefit of Iesus Christ, and to appropriate his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>Now that which troubleth our Aduersaries in this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is, that the word <hi>Faith,</hi> and also the word <hi>Iustifie,</hi> by them is taken in another sence then it is meant in the Scripture, as often as it speaketh of our iustification before God. For the Councell of Trent in the sixt Session, and all our Aduersaries, by iustifying vnderstand regenerating &amp; sanctifying; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the holy Scripture, when it speaketh of our iustification before God, alwayes taketh the word <hi>Iustifying</hi> for <hi>absoluing,</hi> in the same sence that a man accused of a crime, is dismissed, being absolued and iustified. That appeareth by this, that iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifying is opposed against condemning; and consequently, is as much as absoluing. As in Prouerbs, chapter 17. verse 15. <hi>He that iustifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the iust,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:11462:83"/> euen they both are abhomination to the Lord.</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> chapter 9. verse 20. <hi>If I iustifie my selfe, mine owne mouth shall condemne me.</hi> And Deut. 25.1. <hi>Then they shall iustifie the righteous, and condemne the wicked.</hi> And <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.37. <hi>By thy words thou shalt be iustified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.</hi> And Romans chap. 8. verse 33. <hi>It is God that iustifieth, who shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is manifest by the first of the Corinthians, chapter 4. ver. 4. what the Apostle vnderstandeth by <hi>Iustifying,</hi> and how he maketh account to be iustified. Speaking of his administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his Apostleship, he saith: <hi>For I know nothing by my selfe, yet am I not thereby iustified.</hi> He maketh not account to be iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified by his innocencie, which should be false, if by Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation he vnderstood holinesse of life, or regeneration, or if he pretended to be iustified by his workes. And in <hi>Mathew,</hi> chapter 11. verse 19. it is said that <hi>Wisedome is iustified by her children.</hi> Will our Aduersaries say, that the wisedome of God was regenerated or sanctified? It is most manifest that Iesus Christ would onely say, That the wisedome of God was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be iust, and exempted from the slanders of men.</p>
                     <p>If man be iustified by the workes of the Law, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did wrong to magnifie with <hi>Dauid, The blessednesse of those men to whom God imputeth righteousnesse without workes. Rom.</hi> 4.6. especially seeing that there he speaketh of the workes of <hi>Abraham</hi> and of <hi>Dauid,</hi> then when they were already in Gods fauour. For these causes, you shall finde that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> neuer exhorteth vs to be iustifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d, because Iustification is not a vertue in man, but a grace of God, whereby he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solueth sinners, in beholding his Sonne. But his Epistles are full of exhortations, to be sanctified and renewed, Romanes chapter 12. vers. 1.2. And therefore, Romans chapter 5. ver. 9. he saith, that <hi>We are iustified by the bloud of Iesus Christ.</hi> And if by iustifying he vnderstood sanctifying or regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting he would rather say, that we are iustified by the Spirit of Christ.</p>

                     <p>It is true that we speake of faith onely, altogether barren or bare &amp;c. but detesting it as a shew of faith, a spirituall drowsinesse, and a prophane sluggishnesse.</p>
                     <p>As for the place of Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> it is nothing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; for in this question we speake of our Iustification be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, but Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speakes of our iustification before men: <hi>Shew me</hi> (saith he) <hi>thy faith by thy workes.</hi> He speaks of making our faith appeare vnto men by our workes. But as touching Iustification before God, the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, That <hi>Abraham</hi> was not iustified by workes: <hi>For if</hi> (saith he) <hi>Abraham were iustified by workes, he hath wherein to reioyce, but not with God.</hi> And if Saint <hi>Iames</hi> intent had bene to proue that <hi>Abraham</hi> was iustified before God by workes, he would not haue contented himselfe to set downe the onely sacrifice of <hi>Isaac,</hi> but would haue shewed the entire course of his obedience during his life. For if a man be iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied before God by workes, it should not be by one onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but by the continuance of an holy and innocent life. <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> seeketh to proue that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh here of faith and of workes, as farre as they serue to saluation, which we willingly confesse. He saith also, that these words
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:11462:84"/>
                        <hi>not onely,</hi> shew that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh of the same sort of iustification.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:11462:85"/> promises of life which are giuen vs in him are apropriated to our vse, and we feele the effects when we accept them, not doubting that being assured by the mouth of God, we be frustrated thereof. That is alwaies to assure euery man of his saluation, and to ground the interiour peace of conscience of the faithfull vpon presumption: which makes men liue without feare, and carelesse of the time to come, as if a man were already in possession. But what is he among them, who (if he haue his right wits) liueth and dieth in this assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, freed of all feare? We may well perswade and assure our selues, that God will hold his promise, but we cannot assure our selues of the vse of his particular will, whereof God in the Scriptures giueth not any infallible promise vnto any man.</hi>

                     <p>Now we enter into the question touching the assurance of man to be saued, which is a point wherein our aduersaries disfigure our Confession, and propound it otherwise then it is. They say that euery one of vs boast and brag, that we haue a particular reuelation thereof, and that among vs euery one assureth himselfe of his saluation. All that is false. For, to be assured of our saluation, we need not enter into the secret counsell of God. Whosoeuer seeketh by curiositie to enter into it, shall therein find his condemnation. Whosoeuer will presume to climbe so high, shall be throwne downe by des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire. The certaintie of our saluation ought not to be sought for so farre off: it is found in the examination of our owne consciences, conferred with the doctrine of the Scriptures. For if being earnestly conuerted by true repentance we haue recourse to Iesus Christ, and feele in our consciences that we haue no other hope nor affiance but in his death and passion, we haue the doctrine of the Gospell which declareth vnto vs, that <hi>whosoeuer beleeueth in him should not perish, but haue eternall life,</hi> Ioh. 3.15. This is the foundation of our assurance, and the support of our faith.</p>
                     <p>It is also false, that euery one of vs boasteth that he is as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of his saluation. It is true, that God commandeth vs to be assured thereof, but he wils vs not to boast, nor make
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:11462:85"/> open profession of it: and we are not bound to beleeue those t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>at brag thereof For prophane persons may boast of it, who by a vaine confidence imagine they shall ascend vp into heauen while in the meane time their vices weigh them downe into hell.</p>
                     <p>And which is more, this full certainty of faith, is a gift which God giueth not to all the faithfull at one time, nor in like measure; to some he giueth it sooner, to others later, to some onely at the houre of death, and there are some who by prayer and good works seeking to fortifie their faith, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse assailed with doubts touching the same, and haue not as yet that full confidence: who if they perceiue any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding thereof in themselues, and an earnest desire to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease this faith, we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ir election.</p>
                     <p>Then our Confession consisteth in these two points, the one, that God will haue vs to be assured of the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his promise; the other, that God giueth this assurance to whom, when and in what measure it pleaseth him; but specially at the houre of death: for then certainly it is most necessarie.</p>
                     <p>This doctrine is grounded vpon the holy Scriptures. The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 8.16. saith, <hi>The Spirit of God witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth with our spirits, that we are the children of God.</hi> Can there be a more credible witnesse then the Spirit of God? Can we without horror reade that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith, chap. 9. in his third booke of Iustification, that the testimony of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit is not certaine, but by a coniecturall certainty? that is, an vncertaine certaintie. <hi>He that beleeueth in that Sonne of God, hath the witnesse of God in himselfe.</hi> Ioh. 1.5.10. We can not without impietie accuse the testimony of God of vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie. If <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> doth not feele this testimony in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, it is better for him to haue a bad opinion of himselfe, then to contradict the word of God, or to seeke to measure other men by his owne measure, and to limite the grace of God in others, by the euill estate of his owne conscience.</p>

                     <p>The Apostle to the Hebrewes, 3.6. will haue vs <hi>to hold fast vnto the end the confidence and the glorie of the hope.</hi> And 4.16. <hi>Let vs therefore go boldly vnto the throne of grace, that we may receiue mercy, and find grace to helpe in time of need.</hi> And 10.22. <hi>Let vs draw neare with a true heart in assurance of faith.</hi> For saith he, Ephes. 3.12. that <hi>by Iesus Christ we haue boldnesse, and entrance with confidence by faith in him.</hi> And Iohn, 1.13. will haue vs to be assured of eternall life: <hi>These things haue I written vnto you that beleeue in the name of the Sonne of God, that ye may know that ye haue life eternall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Let vs adde hereunto the promise of God, which is, to giue vs all things that we shall aske of him in the name of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, Ioh. 16.23. Let vs aske of him saluation and perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance in faith, for God promiseth to heare vs: and therefore Saint <hi>Iames</hi> 1.6. will haue vs <hi>to aske in faith, and wauer not.</hi> Therefore we must aske saluation of God without doubt or distrust.</p>
                     <p>Of this ranke are those places in the Scriptures, which compare the testimony of the Spirit in the hearts of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to a seale, or an earnest penny to assure vs. Ephes. 1.13. <hi>Wherein also after that ye beleeued, ye were sealed with the holy Spirit of promise, which is the earnest of our inheritance:</hi> and 4.30. <hi>And grieue not the holy Spirit, by whom ye are sealed vnto the day of redemption.</hi> And 2.

                     <p>The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8.37. saith, <hi>For I am assured that neither death nor life, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor any other creature shall be able to separate vs from the loue of God, which is in Iesus Christ our Lord.</hi> For which cause also, going to die, he speaketh as if he had the prize in his owne hand, and as being ready to lay hold vpon the crowne: 2. Tim. 4.7.8. <hi>I haue fought a good fight, and haue finished my course, I haue kept the faith: from henceforth is layd vp for me the crowne of righteousnesse.</hi> And a little after: <hi>The Lord will deliuer me from euery euill worke, and will preserue me vnto his heauenly kingdome.</hi> Is there any thing fuller of assurance, then that which <hi>Iacob</hi> said lying on his death-bed, Genes. 49.18. <hi>I haue

                     <p>All these holy seruants of God are condemned by the Councell of Trent, which saith thus in the sixt Session: Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer shall say, that the regenerated and the righteous man is bound to beleeue with certaine confidence that he is of the number of those that are predestinated, let him be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed.</p>
                     <p>By pride or presumption to curse a man that obeyes God commanding vs to be assured, and which putteth his trust in the promise of God, is to contest and striue with God vnder the shadow of humility. This humility is prophane, and this modesty is iniurious vnto God. It is as if a man should say to God, It is true that thou hast promised me, but I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to beleeue thy word: I am too base to trust in thy promise. To ground the assurance of our saluation vpon our merits, is presumption: but to ground our assurance vpon the promise of God, is faith and obedience.</p>
                     <p>Neuerthelesse, to proue that we may be incredulous with reason, <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> alledgeth two things. First, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not assure our selues of the vse of our will. Whereunto I say, that God hath promised to gouerne our wils,<note n="*" place="margin">And I will make an euer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lasting coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with thē that I will not turne away from them to do thē good: but I will put my feare in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me.</note> and to put his Law in our hearts, and to make vs that we shall not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw our selues from him, Iere. 32.40. And Iesus Christ saying, Mar. 13.22. that <hi>False Christs shall arise, and false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and shall shew signes and wonders to deceiue, if it were possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the very elect,</hi> sheweth that the elect cannot be seduced with a finall seduction or irrecouerable. And God also pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to heare vs, when we aske perseuerance of him. To conclude, so many places before alledged, which will haue vs to be assured of our saluation, presuppose that God also will haue vs to be assured y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> he will not forsake vs: for without that

                     <p>The other reason alledged by <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> is, that God in the Scriptures makes no man any infallible promise.

For if <hi>Henry</hi> or <hi>Charles</hi> be not bound to be assured of his saluation, because it is not said in the Scripture, that <hi>Henry</hi> or <hi>Charles</hi> by name shall be saued, it followeth that those persons are not bound to be honest men, nor to feare God, because in the holy Scripture it is not said, that <hi>Henry</hi> or <hi>Charles</hi> ought to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest men. As the generall rules of piety bind all particular persons: so the generall promise, that whosoeuer beleeueth in Iesus Christ hath life euerlasting, assureth euery particular person thereof that beleeues in Iesus Christ, although his name be not specified in the Scripture.</p>

                        <hi>Places of the Scripture noted in the margent of the Confession.

These two places containe conditionall propositions, and therefore insufficient to giue the pretended assurance. The one saith, If you beleeue, the other saith, Whosoeuer beleeueth; but neither the one nor the other make any assurance, that such or such a particular person is endowed with true faith, nor that if he were so endowed, that he should perseuere. And the Sonne of God speaketh of a working faith: then where are the tearmes that in them containe a safe conduct of assurance?</hi>

                     <p>It is the same obiection that we haue formerly cleared, in the end of the last section. The Scripture nameth not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar persons, but giueth generall rules which binde them. We confesse that this proposition; <hi>Whosoeuer beleeueth in Iesus Christ hath life euerlasting,</hi> is conditionall, and that life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall is giuen onely to those that beleeue. But this condition is not doubtfull, because it dependeth vpon the counsell of God, and vpon his election, by the which he hath predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the elect to beleeue, and to do good workes. The Scripture saith not, that God hath elected any one because he is faithfull, but that God hath giuen him grace to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, to the end that he should be saued. So Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 7.25. saith not, that God determined to shew mercy vnto him if he were faithfull; but saith, <hi>I haue obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithfull.</hi> And Ephes. 1.4. he saith not, that God hath elected vs, because he foresaw that we should be holy, but, <hi>that we should be holy, and without blame before him in loue.</hi> And Iohn 15.16. <hi>I haue chosen you, and ordained you, that you go and bring forth fruite.</hi> And Rom. 8.29. he saith, that <hi>God hath predestinated vs, to be made like to the image of his Sonne.</hi> Our faith and obedience is not a condition whereupon ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction dependeth, but an effect of election, and grace which God giueth to all those whom he hath elected to saluation. I ioyne faith with obedience, because faith it selfe in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect is a kind of obedience, and because it worketh by cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, Galat. 5.6. In the thirteenth of the Acts, the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> preached the Gospell in Antiochia. Of all his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, those onely which were ordained to life euerlasting beleeued, as it is said, verse 48.

For on the contrary 1. Cor. 4.3, he declareth: <hi>I passe very little to be iudged by you, or of mans iudgement.</hi> The Apostle fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to offend God, and to faile in his charge: which is a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant feare, and not a feare of the distrust of his saluation: whereof he speaketh as assured,<note place="margin">I haue fought a good fight, I haue fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed my course; I haue kept the faith, from henceforth is laid vp for me the crowne of righteousnes.</note> in the passages before alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Rom. 8.37. and 2.

Iesus Christ auoyded dangers, although he knew that his houre was not yet come. <hi>Ezechias</hi> had a promise to liue fifteene yeares more: and yet he ceassed not to eate, to attaine to that time. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts, 27.31, had a promise of God, that he should scape shipwracke, &amp; yet ceased not to exhort the sailers to worke. So the faithfull man assured of his saluation, ceasseth not to trauell by those meanes that are fit to attaine thereunto; which assurance is not grounded vpon his owne force, but vpon Gods promise. Euen as a child that learneth to go, (when his father holds him by the hand,) may be assured that he shall not fall; not because he is strong enough of himselfe, but because his father leades him: so it is with the faithfull, of whom it is said, Psal. 37.24. <hi>Though the iust man falleth, he shall not be vtterly cast downe, for the Lord vpholdeth him with his hand.</hi>

                     <p>Then here you see the difference betweene true and false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is, that true religion fashioneth mens hearts to an humble confidence or assurance, but false religion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them to a proud distrust. Which pride as it is prophane, so also their distrust is most iust. For he that trusteth in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, careth not for assurance. For hauing laid his foundation in the aire, his expectation must of force hang in suspence. These Doctors teach men to trust in themselues, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strust God: hanging their spirits betweene feare and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, trembling with feare to thinke vpon hell, and in the meane time presuming to haue a degree of glory in heauen aboue the common Saints, which degree by scholers is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Aureola.</hi>

                  <p>He that will exactly examine rhe words of this 21 Article of our Confession, shall find nothing of all that which <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> maketh it to say. It doth not say that all those that haue faith, are assured to continue therein vnto the end, but that faith is giuen to continue to the end, which no man can contradict, but he that will haue a man to leaue and forsake the seruice of God after he hath once begun well. And to be short, in all this Article there is no mention made of the certainty of perseuerance.</p>
                  <p>Neuerthelesse although he wander out of the way, we will follow him by his steps, and manifest and explane vnto the Reader the certainty of perseuerance.</p>
                  <p>First, we do not denie, that there is a faith for a time, and which perseuereth not to the end. The Scripture speaketh thereof in many places: as Math. 13.20. Ioh. 2.22.23. Hebr. 6.4.5.6 and in other places.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we confesse and acknowledge that the faith of the elect groweth by degrees, and that as it waxeth stronger, so the certainty of perseuerance increaseth. Yet while it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaseth, there is still some remnant of infirmitie in man, and the flesh suggesteth doubts, so that this certainty is not giuen to all the elect in like measure.</p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:11462:91"/>
                  <p>Onely we say, that whosoeuer turneth vnto God by true repentance, and by an vnfained faith, hath apprehended the benefit of Iesus Christ, and the promise of God: he ought to be assured and to beleeue that God will not forsake him and will giue him grace to perseuer, and that God will haue vs to haue this assurance, and promiseth vs perseuerance. And that he giueth this assurance to his elect, to some soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to others later, and in diuerse measure: but that specially he giueth it to his children at the houre of death.</p>
                  <p>This certainty of perseuerance is taught vnto vs in the word of God: Iere. 32.39.40. where God makes this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, <hi>I will giue them one heart, and one way, that they may feare me for euer: I will make an euerlasting couenant with them, that I will not turne away from them, to do them good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Iesus Christ, Marke 13.22. saith, that <hi>False Christs shall rise, and false Prophets, and shall shew signes and wonders, to deceiue, if it were possible, the elect.</hi> Shewing that the elect cannot finally be seduced, and by consequence shall pers<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uer vnto the end. Therefore the Apostle in the beginning of his Epistle to <hi>Titus,</hi> calleth this faith whereof we speake, <hi>the faith of the elect:</hi> to shew that it can no more faile then election it selfe. Whether it differ in kind, or in degree onely from tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall faith, yet the certainty thereof is not grounded vpon his owne force, but vpon the continuall aide and assistance of God: and this assistance depends vpon election.</p>
                  <p>Iesus Christ Ioh. 6.39. saith <hi>This is the Fathers will which hath sent me, that of all which he hath giuen me, I should lose no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> Now those whom the Father hath giuen to Iesus Christ are the elect, whom seeing Iesus Christ promiseth not to lose, but to keepe them alwayes, it is necessary that they should perseuer vnto the end.</p>
                  <p>Our Lord, Ioh. 4.14 speaking of the Spirit which he giueth to those that are his, promiseth <hi>To giue them water, whereof whosoeuer drinketh shall neuer be more athirst, but that it shall be in him a well of water springing vp vnto eternall life:</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without perseuering to the end.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8.35. assureth himselfe of this perseue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:11462:91"/> saying, <hi>Who shall separate vs from the loue of Christ?</hi> And a little after, 38. <hi>For I am assured, that neither death, nor life, nor Angels, &amp;c. shall be able to separate vs from the loue of God.</hi> So Iesus Christ promiseth the gift of perseuerance to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Luk. 22.32 when he saith vnto him, <hi>I haue prayed for thee that thy faith faile not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the first Psalme, the faithfull are compared to a tree whose leaues neuer fall. Iesus Christ compareth them to a man that hath built his house vpon a rocke, which standeth fast against all stormes and tempests, Matth. 7.24. Saint <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in his first Epistle 1.23. saith that <hi>The word of God dwelling in their hearts, is an vncorruptible seed, liuing, and enduring for euer.</hi> And before verse 5. he said, that <hi>We are kept by the power of God, through faith, vnto saluation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the same end it is said, that the true faithfull are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called members of Iesus Christ: for it is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, that Sathan can cut off or pull away the members of Iesus Christ, nor yet diminish his body. As also that the regeneration of the faithfull is called a birth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.3. and a resurrection, Reuel. 20.6. For this second birth cannot be made voyde by death. And the Spirit of God, Reuel. 20.6. saith, that <hi>The second death</hi> (which is damnation) <hi>hath no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer on him that hath part in the first resurrection.</hi> Now if a man truly regenerated could entirely lose faith and godlinesse, and after returne againe and be reestablished by repentance; besides this second birth, whereof the Scripture speaketh, there should be a third and fourth birth, whereof the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture maketh no mention. And if we had not so many places of the Scripture for the certainty of perseuerance, yet so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places alledged in the 46. Section, whereby God will haue vs to be assured of our saluation, necessarily presuppose the assurance of perseuerance: for without it saith wauereth, and floateth in vncertaintie.</p>
                  <p>All this is grounded vpon the constant and vnuariable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; vpon the nature of God, whose gifts and callings are without repentance, Rom. 11.29: vpon the promises of God before set downe. God dresseth that which he hath
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:11462:92"/> planted. He giueth, because he hath formerly giuen. His first graces inuite and draw on those that follow, and are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises for the time to come.</p>
                  <p>It may well fall out, that the faith of the faithfull hardly assailed, may sometime languish, as those that faint and fall into a swoune. So it hapned to <hi>Dauid, Salomon,</hi> and Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and to many faithfull seruants of God, whom yet God recouered againe out of their trance. For, that <hi>Dauid</hi> in his fall did not wholly lose the Spirit of God, it appeareth by that which he himselfe saith, Psal. 51.11. <hi>Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me.</hi> Then he had that Spirit still. As for <hi>Salomon,</hi> God himselfe, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14.15. promised, that <hi>If he committed iniquitie, he would cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten him with the rod of men, but that his mercie should not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from him.</hi> Whereby it appeareth that by this doctrine we do not make our selues without sinne, as <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> chargeth vs.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit this perseuerance, although it be necessarie, is neuerthelesse voluntary, and without constraint. In the 21. Section we haue shewed, that there are voluntary necessities, and that constraint and not necessitie, is repugnant to liberty. All of vs necessarily desire to be happy, and yet with freedome of will. It is not to be asked, whether the Elect can resist the grace of God, for all of them for a time resist it, and of their owne nature can do no other thing. But God in his secret counsell hath decreed, to bend theit wils, that they will not resist vnto the end. That which <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> makes vs and <hi>Caluine</hi> say, that all the workes of the saithfull are worthy of death, is slanderous, and nothing to the purpose.</p>

                  <p>This is a blow on the naile, by our Aduersary giuen to three places of Scripture set downe in the margent of the 21. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Confession to shew that they are wrongly alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to proue the certainty of perseuerance; which is asmuch as to fight against his owne shadow: for those places are not brought to proue the certainty of perseuerance, wherof there is nothing spoken in that Article.</p>
                  <p>Adde hereunto, that we haue already confuted that in the 47. Section, where we haue shewed that Gods decree to giue perseuerance to his Elect, is not a conditionall but an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute decree. And it were a contradiction to say, that God giueth perseuerance to the faithfull, if they pers uere: or to speake (as <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> saith) that by the grace of God they shall be constant, so they be constant. But specially he speaketh with a good grace, to say that there shall be no wanting on Gods behalfe. This Doctor imagineth, that God saith vnto vs, Do your indeuour, and I will do mine: It is not my fault, but you hinder me from doing that which I would willingly do. This Diuinitie is hypochondriacall: and the example which he setteth down in his answer is childish. If (saith he) I should say to a sicke person, The Physitian will aide and not leaue you to the end, should it thence follow,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:11462:93"/> that the sicke man cannot disobey the Physitions order. Certes God is not like a Physition, that cannot giue the will to his patient to suffer himselfe to be ruled: but God giueth his Spirit to his Elect, which formeth them to obedience.</p>
                  <p>The place of Scripture; <hi>Thy destruction cometh from thy selfe O Israel;</hi> is not to the purpose, touching the perseuerance of the Elect: for that is spoken of reprobates.</p>

                  <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in that place speaketh to those that are presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and negligent, and that trust in their owne strength, and saith vnto them, Let him that thinketh himselfe to be very sure and firme, take heed that he falleth not into such faults, whereby his presumption and weakenesse may be knowne. For by <hi>falling</hi> he vnderstandeth not to lose faith, as <hi>M. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noux</hi> imagineth, but to fall into faults, whereby his false trust may be conuinced. But to gratifie our Aduersarie, put the case that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes to those that haue true faith. In that sence, I say, that either the Apostle speaketh of finall falling, whence men neuer recouer again; or of faults, whence men recouer againe, and which sometimes befall the most holy men, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Dauid &amp;c.</hi> If he speake of faults whence men recouer again, this makes nothing against finall perseuerance, which we speake of here. If he speakes of finall falling, and whence men neuer recouer againe, this instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not vnprofitable to those that are assured of their salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For those that truly stand vpright, should not be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of falling. The assurance that they haue to go into the kingdome of God, hindereth them not from turning out of
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:11462:93"/> the way to hell, but bindeth them to be warie thereof. For mans will ought to obey Gods decree. Those whom God hath ordained to perseuer vnto the end, ought to vse the meanes to attaine thereunto: he whom God hath preordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to liue an hundred yeares, should be carefull not to want food by his negligence. For the confidence which we haue that God will saue vs, is no cause of negligence. And to be short, to the end that no man should serue their turnes with that place of Scriptu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And although God to accomplish our saluation doth regenerate vs, reforming vs to do good: neuerthelesse, we confesse, that the good workes which we do by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the holy Ghost, are not required to iustifie vs, or to merit that God therefore should hold vs for his children, for that we should alwayes fleet in doubt and vnquietnesse; if our consciences did not rest vpon the satisfaction whereby Iesus Christ hath freed vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God.</q>

To know with what equity he dealeth with vs, let the Reader remember, that before in the fiftieth Section he saith that we make our selues without fault, that is without sinne; and now he attributeth the contrary vnto vs, and maketh vs say, that the holiest Ministers dare not assure themselues that they do good workes. So before he reproued vs, that we make a bare faith, voyde of good workes; but here he himselfe produceth our Confession which saith that faith necessarily produceth good workes. By this meanes he iustifieth vs, and silently confesseth that he hath slandered vs. Otherwise these things agree well together, for a man to haue a certaine confidence or faith accompanied with good workes, and yet not to trust in his owne good workes: for the more that a man trusteth in God, the more he distrusteth himselfe; the more that a man resteth vpon the merits of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, the more he renounceth his owne merits.</p>

                  <p>These places serue to proue that which our Confession saith, that is, that faith stirreth in vs an affection to liue well, and necessarily produceth good workes. The Scripture is full of proofes thereof. The Apostle to the Hebrewes, 11.32. and 33. maketh a great rehearsall of the seruants of God, who by faith did worke righteousnesse. Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> Acts 15.9. saith, that <hi>God hath purified the hearts of the Gentiles by faith.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 8.1. saith, that <hi>There is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, which walke not after the flesh but after the Spirit.</hi> Adde to that the places quoted in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent of our Confession, which <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> produceth; Iam. 2.14. that <hi>Faith without workes cannot saue.</hi> Galat. 5.6. that <hi>Faith worketh by loue:</hi> which fiue places <hi>M.

I am ashamed to trouble my selfe, with such childish things If in our Confession we had said, that God is necessarily iust, <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> would haue quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled with vs about it, and would haue said, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture saith that God is iust, but saith not, that he is necessarily iust. What? Is not the word of God necessarily true? And when the Apostle saith, that faith worketh by loue, is it not necessary that it should worke by loue, to be that faith whereof the Apostle speaketh? Is it probably onely or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent that faith moueth vs to good workes? that is, not to speake like a man, nor vnto men.</p>

Such a faith is without good workes. But not the faith of the true faithfull seruants of God, by the which they are iustified before God.</p>

Neuerthelesse we confesse that the good workes which we do by the guidance of his Spirit are not brought into an account to iustifie vs, or to merite that God should esteeme vs for his children.

                     <p>The holy Scripture speaketh but of one iustification, by the which a sinner is iustified before God, which iustification is the absolution of a sinner by vertue of the death of Iesus Christ, &amp; by the imputation of his righteousnesse. The Church of Rome which by iustification vnderstandeth regeneration or sanctification, may not onely make two iustifications, but an hundred also, if they will take the degrees of our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in our regeneration for so many iustifications.</p>
                     <p>In the meane time it is good to know in what sence <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> confesseth that we are freely iustified. The holy Scripture attributeth the remission of sinnes to the mercy of God, and to the redemption in Iesus Christ; but for sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or regeneration, it is an effect of the holy Spirit, which for that cause is called the spirit of sanctification. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Apostle, Rom. 5.9. saith, that we are iustified by the bloud of Iesus Christ, and 3.23. that we are freely iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, it is clearer then the day light, that by iustifying he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth absolution, and not regenerating. These words of free regenerating sound not currantly: but to say that God freely pardoneth vs, is to speake according to reason and agreable to the holy Scripture. Colos. 2.13. <hi>He hath freely pardoned vs all our offences.</hi> But the Church of Rome, which peruerteth all the Scripture, by iustifying freely, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth freely to regenerate. And thereby maketh two rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, whereof the first is freely, and the other not freely, but merited, as if God gaue vs some graces not freely, nor of his meere liberalitie.</p>

                        <hi>But they pretend, that workes done by the grace of the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, are not meritorious; as if the holy Spirit were not able to worke in vs, and by vs, and with vs, such things as are worthy of himselfe.</hi>

                     <p>Our aduersaries will haue workes done by grace and the aide of the holy Ghost to be meritorious. This is a bold asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For there is not any man in France (what seruice so euer he hath done for the king,) that dares presume to say to the king that he hath deserued to be made rich by the king: And which is more, if we merit eternall life, God should be vniust if he giues it not vnto vs; for it is iniustice to withhold a seruants wages from him which he hath deserued. By this meanes we are in a good case, and need do no more but to aske payment of God, if he will not be vniust. Then seeing it is so, it shall not be amisse to examine these merits, and to know the value and possibilitie of them.</p>
                     <p>In this point the Masse and the Councell of Trent are at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance. For in the Canon of the Masse which is said euery day, the Priest maketh this prayer: Receiue vs into the fellowship of thy Saints,<note n="*" place="margin">Non est aesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mator meriti sed veniae lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitor.</note> not weighing our merits, but granting vs par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, by Iesus Christ our Lord. But the Councell of Trent in the sixth Session hath ordained otherwise,<note n="**" place="margin">Si quis dixerit homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis iustificati bona opera ita esse dona Dei vt non sint etiam bona ip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius iustificati merita, &amp;c. Anathemasit.</note> defining, that the good workes of a righteous man are in such manner gifts of God, as that they are also our merits; and that a man (by the grace of God) may not onely merite eternall life, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so an augmentation of glory, that is, a degree of blessednesse in heauen more then ordinarie. The opinion of <hi>Thomas</hi> is,<note n="*" place="margin">

But that the same merits for so much as they proceede from our owne free will, onely merite by congruitie, and by right of well beseeming or correspondence, but not in rigor of iustice.</p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:11462:97"/>
                     <p>But now adayes merits are higher aduanced. Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> which wrote in Rome with a generall approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and is commonly followed; in his fifth booke, chap. 7. of Iustification saith,<note n="*" place="margin">Magis hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificū est ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere aliquid ex merito quā ex sola dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</note> that it is more honorable to obtaine a thing by a mans owne desert, then to haue it by the onely gift of God. And in the foureteenth chapter he saith,<note n="*" place="margin">Deus consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuet absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam aequalita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem inter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pera &amp; mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedes, vt vnus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisque non minorem ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat mercedē quàm iusto iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicio merea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quod est iustitiae com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutatinae.</note> That God will wholly equalize the worke and the reward, to the end that no man should haue lesse recompence then he deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, to iudge rightly, which is commutatiue iustice; This iustice is that which giues one for another, or so much for so much. And after he hath gone about (in the seuenteenth chapter) to proue, that good workes <hi>etiam sine pacto,</hi> that is, without the promise of God, haue a proportion with life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall, he concludeth his proposition by a doctrine which he saith to be the common doctrine of Diuines, which is, that the good workes of the righteous merite eternall life by condignity or worthinesse, not onely in consideration of the promise and the acceptation, but also in consideration of the worke, in such sort that in good works proceeding from grace, there is a proportion and equalitie to the price of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life; from whence he inferreth, in the eighteenth chapter,<note n="*" place="margin">
                           <hi>17 §</hi> Iam ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rò opera bona iustorum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritoria esse vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae aeternae, non solum ratione pacti &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptationis, sed etiam rae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione operis, ita vt in opere bono ex gratia procedence, sit quaedam pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portio &amp; ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualitas ad praenium vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tae aeternae.</note>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Non ex sola promissione sed etiam ex opere nostro Deus efficitur debitor.</note> That God is become debtor vnto vs, not onely because of his promise, but also because of our workes. So that we may say, that this Prelate is ready with Counters in his hand, to reckon with God, and to shew him how much he oweth vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>The beleefe of our Church is contrary to that. We say, that good workes are necessarie to saluation; not as causes of saluation, but as the way to attaine thereunto; <hi>via regni non causa regnandi.</hi> Good workes serue to glorifie God to edifie our neighbour, by exercise thereof to strengthen faith, to leade vs to saluation. But they are not the price of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of saluation, which is sufficiently gotten for vs by the free redemption obtained by Iesus Christ.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 It is sufficient to possesse or enioy the kingdom of God, as children of God; and by the title of Heires, and receiue it of free gift, without boasting, to possesse it by the title of

Seeing that we haue in our hands a price of infinite value, whereby the kingdome of God is obtained for vs, that is, the merite of our Lord Iesus Christ, what neede haue we to buy that with our owne merites, which Iesus Christ hath bought for vs, and which God of his meere liberalitie giueth vnto vs?</p>
                     <p n="2">2 The holy Scripture pricketh this swelling pride, and wholly bereaueth man of this confidence, and trust in his merites. For it calleth saluation a gift of God, and not a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase by our merits, Ephes. 2.23. <hi>For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternall life,</hi> Rom. 6.23. Vpon which place Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith thus:<note place="margin">Cap. <hi>9.</hi> de gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia &amp; libero arbitrio.

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>reby we should vnderstand, that God leadeth vs to life eternall by his mercie, and not by our merites.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The same Apostle, 2, Tim. 1.9. saith, <hi>He hath saued vs, and called vs with an holy calling, not according to our workes, but according to his owne purpose and grace, which was giuen vnto vs through Iesus Christ before the world was.</hi> Note these words, <hi>He hath saued vs,</hi> to confute <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> glosse, who onely confesseth, that the first iustification, that is, the beginning of regeneration proceedeth not from our merites, but touching saluation he saith that we merite it. Cleane contrary to the Apostle, who denyeth that we are saued by our workes.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Therefore, when question is made, to know by what meanes we obtaine eternall saluation, the same Apostle op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth the grace of God against workes, as things disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Rom. 4.4. <hi>To him that worketh, the wages is not counted by fauour, but by debt.</hi> You may well say he speakes to our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, saying: To you which put your trust in your works, the reward of life eternall must not be reputed for a free gift of God, but for a thing due vnto you: as before we haue heard <hi>Bellarmine</hi> boast that God is debtor vnto vs. And you must note, that the Apostle speaks of <hi>Abraham</hi> then when he beleeued in God, and that faith was imputed vnto him for righteousnesse; to the end that no man should thinke or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:11462:98"/> that he spake of vnregenerated persons, or of workes that are done by naturall force.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 The same Apostle, Romans 11.6. saith, <hi>If it be of grace, it is no more workes, or else grace were no more grace: But if it be of workes, it is no more grace, or else worke were no more workes.</hi> Then to obtaine eternall life by the grace of God, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it by our workes, are things contrarie. The merits of our aduersaries are they not works? And if they obtaine saluation by their merits, saluation is no more a grace of God. Some of them excuse themselues and say, that we merite by the ayde and help of the grace of God, and that our merits are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, vnlesse they be died with the blood of Iesus Christ, and that Iesus Christ merites makes ours auaileable.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Whereby they get nothing, for seeing that the grace of God excludes mans merites, how shall we merite by his grace? Did Iesus Christ merite that I might merite, seeing it is the merite of Iesus Christ which makes my merites su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous? for he merited expresly to the end that we should no more be bound to obtaine saluation by our merits. The Apostle to exclude the merites of workes, propoundeth the grace of God, saying: <hi>If it be by grace it is not by workes.</hi> Then how wil they haue vs to merit by grace? To merite by grace, is a thing as much disagreeing as for a man to freese with heate, or to be wet with drinesse. For grace presupposeth a gift, and to merite is a kinde of buying: so to merite by grace, is to buy by meere gift, which is a ridiculous conceit.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 To conclude, God giueth no man grace to derogate or disparage his grace, nor vertue to obtaine by merites a thing already fully gotten by the merite of Iesus Christ. As for this imaginarie dying with the blood of Christ, I say <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>hat Iesus Christ doth not die our workes with so high a colour. Let vs rather learne to disburthen our soules of pride, then to stuffe this shapelesse idole, inuented by men, besides, yea contrary to the word of God.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 The example of yong children that die shortly after they are baptized, is most cleare and manifest for this pu pose. For our Aduersaries grant that those children possesse life e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:11462:99"/> without merites, by vertue of the free adoption in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. Now there is not diuers meanes of saluation according to the diuersitie of persons, in such manner that one should be saued without merites, and another by his merites.</p>
                     <p n="9">9 Free election is an inuincible proofe against merites. The Scripture speaketh of men elected, predestinated, and preordained to eternall life, Ephesians 1.4.5. Romans 8.9. Acts 13.48. And saith, that this election is free. <hi>Paul.</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it, <hi>The election of grace,</hi> Romans 11.5.6. Now to shew how it is by grace, he expoundeth it adding that it is not by workes, saying: <hi>Euen so then at this present there is a remnant according to the election of grace. And if it be of grace, it is no more of works.</hi> And 9.11.16. <hi>That the purpose of God might remaine according to election, not by workes, but by him that calleth.</hi> And then addeth: <hi>So then it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth, but in God that sheweth mercy.</hi> To attaine to this sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation whereunto they are predestinated, God freely giueth them his holy Spirit, which imprinteth faith in them, and fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth their mindes to good workes. Ephes. 1.4. <hi>As he hath chosen vs in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy.</hi> Philip. 2.13. <hi>For it is God which worketh in you both the will and the deede, euen of his good pleasure, Iohn</hi> 15.5. <hi>For without me can ye do nothing.</hi> 2. Cor. 3.5. <hi>But our sufficiencie is of God.</hi> Then if we haue not merited to be elected to saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we haue not merited to be saued. If neither the election to saluation, nor the meanes giuen vs to attaine to this salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are not merited, how shall this saluation be merited? To say, that God hath freely predestinated vs to merite salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is to contradict our selues. For it is as much as to say, that God freely predestinateth vs to be saued but not freely. If a man should freely giue me an house or an inheritāce, two hundred miles from hence, vpon condition to go thither to take possession thereof, and conducteth me on the way, nourisheth me, releeueth me when I fall, setteth me in the way when I go wrong, giueth me strength to go vntill such time as he putteth me in possession: can I say that I haue
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:11462:99"/> gotten this inheritance by my merits? shall my steps be the price of the acquisition or getting thereof? This giuer is God, those to whom it is giuen are the Elect, the inheritance giuen is the kingdome of heauen; the way to attaine thereunto, are the commandements of God: euery good worke is a step in this way. In which way if we stumble, or go wrong, God vpholdeth vs, and sets vs in the way againe, giueth vs strength to go forward: and being at the end of our iourney shall we be so brutish to presume to reckon our steps for merits? yea and for merits of condignitie or equiualence, and to thinke that God is debter vnto vs? But what can the creator owe to the creature? or what can he owe vnto vs, vnto whom we owe our selues?</p>
                     <p n="10">10 Those that are of opinion that God hath not elected this or that man because or in consideration of his good workes, but because he foresaw that they should beleeue in Iesus Christ, fall into the like inconuenience; because they speake of faith as of a kind of worke, and of a vertue in the faithfull, which they make to precede the election of God. And I see no reason why they will not haue good workes also a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which preceds the election of God, seeing that God electeth none but those that shall do good workes, and that good workes are as necessary to saluation as faith is. Then we must say, that God hath freely elected those whom it pleased him, and that to them freely and without merit he giueth his holy Spirit, which in their hearts imprinteth a liuely faith working by charity.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 If we will comprehend what this word <hi>merit</hi> impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, the difficulty would soone be decided. There are sixe things required to merit.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 The worke that is done must not be a worke that is due to be done for it is no merit for a man to pay his debts.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 We must offer that which is our own. For to present any thing to the king that belongs vnto him, that is no merit.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The worke that a man doth to merit of any man, must be fit for his vse and purpose: for a man cannot merit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man by a worke that is not good nor profitable for him.</p>
                     <pb n="166" facs="tcp:11462:100"/>
                     <p n="4">4 The worke that we do to merit withall, must not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue, and wherein there is any thing to be pardoned.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 There must be some proportion betweene the worke and the reward that a man will merit by the worke.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Lastly, the thing that we desire to obtaine by merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious workes, must not be already obtained by another for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer meanes: for to seeke of a proprietary or possessor, to be a purchaser, it is to remit our propriety. By these sixe reasons following the word of God teacheth vs that we cannot merit of God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1 First, all the good that we do, is a thing due, as Iesus Christ saith, Luke 17.10. <hi>So likewise when you haue done all these things which are commanded you, say, we are vnprofitable seruants, we haue done that which was our dutie to do.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2 All the good that we do comes from God, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence cannot merit at Gods hands. 2. Cor. 3.5. <hi>Not that we are sufficient of our selues to thinke any thing, as of our selues, but our sufficiency is of God.</hi> Phil. 2.13. <hi>For it us God which wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth in you both the will and the deed, euen of his good pleasure.</hi> He crowneth his owne gifts, and repayeth not our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Our workes are no profit vnto him. Psal. 16.2. <hi>My good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse extendeth not to thee.</hi> It is true that they are pleasing vnto God, for God loueth that which he doth, but yet they are not meritorious. For if they merited, it should be God that should merit, and not man. The Mother <hi>Terese,</hi> translated by <hi>Monsieur de Berulle,</hi> which nameth himselfe the Confessor of the blessed, saith with a good grace, that the seruants of God haue taken so much paines to aide our Lord. cap. 3. fol. 11.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Moreouer, our good workes are imperfect, and there is alwayes some defect in them, Rom. 7. <hi>The Spirit striueth against the flesh,</hi> Galat. 5.18. So that we alwayes ought to grow in grace, and alwayes haue need to aske pardon. The loue of a thing is according to the knowledge that a man hath thereof: now, here we know but in part, and obscurely, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Cor 13.9.12. saith: Therefore now we loue but in part and imperfectly.</p>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:11462:100"/>
                     <p n="5">5 If we compare the worke with the reward which we pretend to merit, what comparison is there betweene im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect workes, and which in a moment passe away, and an eternall and celestiall kingdome? Martyrdome is one of the most excellent workes, notwithstanding the Apostle Rom. 8.18. saith, <hi>I count that the afflictions of this present time, are not worthy of the glory which shall be shewed vnto vs.</hi> 2. Cor. 4.17. <hi>Our light affliction which is but for a moment, causeth vnto vs a farre more excellent and an eternall weight of glory.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6 Lastly, how can we by our merits obtaine eternall life, which is already obtained for vs by our redemption in Iesus Christ, and which appertained vnto vs, in as much as we are children of God, adopted in Iesus Christ? Galat. 4.7. <hi>If thou art a sonne, thou art also the heire of God through Christ.</hi> Rom. 8.17. <hi>If we be children, we are also heires, euen the heires of God, &amp; heires annexed with Christ.</hi> Wherupon also the kingdome of God is not called a purchase by our workes, but by an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, Ephes. 1.14.18. Whosoeuer pretendeth by his merits to purchase the inheritance that he hath from his father, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth off childlike affections, and renounceth his succession, and of a sonne and heire, becomes mercenary and a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaser, and in conclusion goeth about to pay God with coyne ouerlight.</p>
                     <p n="12">12 For this also is a great imperfection in the Church of Rome, who not contenting themselues to gaine Paradise by their merits, bring in diuers other workes for merits, which are none, and which not onely do not merit a reward, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deserue punishment: as to pray without vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what they say: to fast for another man: to kisse holy graines: to say their Pater-noster and Aue Marie by tale vpon a paire of beades: to go to the Iubilie: to worship relickes: to run on pilgrimage into Spaine, leauing their houses, worke and families: to make garments to put vpon images: to take from their poore children to giue to rich Monks, &amp;c. These are workes for which God is indebted vnto men, and is in arrerages vnto them. Now if good workes become euill when they are done in pride, as thereby to bind God to men,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:11462:101"/> How much lesse are euill workes meritorious to saluation, and all this trash and trifles of mens inuentions which they present vnto God for merits? For our aduersaries thinke that they haue reason to presume, that God is not vnthankfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those that do good vnto him.</p>
                     <p>The effects of this doctrine of pride are sufficient to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw it. For these men that are so laden with merits, say, that they know not whether they shall be saued or not, and die in feare and disquietnesse of conscience: It is (say they) a kind of rashnesse to assure our selues of our saluation. This distrust is most iust; this doubt of theirs is well grounded, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the trust of our merits is without g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ound. For who knoweth the value or worth of euery merit? Who knowes for how much euery peece of this money goes currant in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise? Who knowes when he hath done merits enough? Therefore the deuoutest men buy other mens merits, &amp; (as the Priest doth in the Masse) aske saluation of God for the merits of Saints.</p>
                     <p>From this assurance &amp; trust that any man hath of his merits, there springeth a most euident consequence, that is, that in stead (as in the Scripture) that faith produceth good workes, here on the contrary, workes produce faith, and are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the hope of saluation. That which <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> thrusteth in by the way touching workes of supererogation, shall be hereafter examined apart.</p>

Let this Doctor learne that God is iust in regarding our good works, not because our workes deserue it, but because Gods promise is such. It is a iust thing to accomplish his promise.

                     <p>It is not enough to seeke to merit life eternall by workes, as our Aduersaries say, for <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> will perswade vs, that there are some which merite more then life eternall, and a degree of glorie in heauen aboue the ordinary sort of men. <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> saith, that those that obserue the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and do no more then that whereunto they
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:11462:104"/> are bound, shall haue no other recompence then that which followeth the obseruation of the commandement, that is to say, that all their recompence shall be life eternall, which is promised to those that accomplish the commandements of God. Those that haue no other perfection, but onely that they haue perfectly obeyed God, are vnprofitable seruants; and incapable of a greater glory: therfore they must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with eternall life without pretending to haue more. But there are some that do more then God will haue them to do: and (as <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> saith) that do something more then that which they are bound to do: those shall haue the full accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishing of the recompence, and a glorie aboue the common sort. This is a new Gospel, drawne out of the vnwritten word, This is a doctrine full of courage, which esteemeth it a small thing to fulfill the Law of God, and studieth for another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, for feare to be an vnprofitable seruant. This surplus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage which is done ouer and aboue that whereunto a man is bound, is that which they call Counsels of perfection, and workes of Supererogation, perfecter, and more excellent then all that which God commandeth in his Law, and more then to loue God with all his heart, and his neighbour as himselfe. Such is perpetuall virginitie, martyrdome, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of all that a man hath vnto the poore, monasticall vowes of obedience, pouerty, and chastity. Of those that do these supererogatorie workes,<note place="margin">§ Quocirca si addam alterū gradum plus quàm teneor atque eo modo facio actum supererogatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis &amp; consilij</note> Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the thirteenth chapter of the booke of Monkes, saith, That they loue God more then they are bound to do. Those (fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Bellarmine) M. Arnoux</hi> saith, are not vnprofitable seruants. But he tells vs not to whom they are profitable: for it is necessarie that they should be profitable, either to God, to themselues, or to their neighbours. To God they are not, for he hath no need of our seruice. Then they must either be profitable to themselues or to their neighbors. Then how are they who by their merites obtaine nothing but life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, called vnprofitable seruants, seeing that <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> will not deny but that they profite themselues, and do the like to their neighbours?</p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="tcp:11462:104"/>
                     <p>We on the contrary, acknowledge our selues to be so farre off from being able to do more then that which God come mandeth, that we are farre from being able to do that which he commandeth; and putting all our hope and confidence in the mercie of God, seeke not after a degree of glorie aboue the ordinarie sort of the elect. In what degree of glorie soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer we be, it sufficeth vs, so we may be with our Sauiour, and see the face of our God. In the meane time we reiect not the counsels which are found in the Scripture. It is wise counsell to abstaine from lawfull things, that a man may the easier ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome himselfe to leaue vnlawfull things. It is wise coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell to abstaine from meates which God permitteth to eate, when a weake conscience may be troubled thereby. It is wise counsell to a Minister of the Church, not to take any reward, when he can make shift without it, or when the aduersaries take occasion thereby to make his preaching suspicious. It is wise counsell to a man that is continent not to marrie, to the end that he may not be diuerted by domesticall cares, and so beare persecution the easier. But we call these counsels, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of Christian wisedome, and not of perfection; the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation whereof is not meritorious, nor supererogatorie, but a thing much lesse then the accomplishment of the Law.</p>
                     <p>Our reasons against these counsels of perfection or works of supererogation are these:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 God in his Law commandeth vs to loue and to serue him with all our hearts, and with all our strength. And a man can do no more then his strength will permit him to do. <hi>Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmine</hi> will, in effect, haue vs by this word <hi>all,</hi>

                     <p n="2">2 The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Philippians, chapter 4.8. commandeth vs <hi>to thinke on those things that are iust, pure, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and honest.</hi> If workes of supererogation be iust and pure, they are commanded by the Apostle, and so are not su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:11462:105"/>
                     <p n="3">3 If a man cannot accomplish the Law, much lesse then can we do more then the Law commands. <hi>Iames</hi> 3.2. <hi>For in many things we sinne all.</hi> 1. Kings 8.46. <hi>For there is no man that sinneth not.</hi> Psalme 116.11. <hi>All men are liers.</hi> All the Apostles daily said, <hi>Forgiue vs our offences. Noah, Abraham, Dauid, Iob,</hi> Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and the most excellent seruants of God, sinned. <hi>Iob</hi> is called iust &amp; perfect, and yet cursed the day of his birth. It is said of <hi>Zacharias</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, Luke</hi> 1.6. that <hi>they were iust before God, and walked in all the commandements and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord, without reproofe.</hi> But these words, <hi>without reproofe,</hi> must be expounded, that they walked in such sort in the commandements of God, that no man could reproue them in any thing: notwithstanding it appeares that <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias</hi> was a sinner; for that not long after he was punished, because he did not beleeue the word of God declared vnto him by the Angell. Then how can we present vnto God more then he asketh, seeing we cannot giue him that which is his due? How can we do superaboundant workes, if we want necessarie workes?</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The perfection of the Angels, Psal. 103.20. is said to consist in executing the commandement of God. Iesus Christ himselfe saith, that he came to do the will of him that sent him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.38, and Hebr. 10.7. These Doctors doing more then the will of God, surpasse the Angels and Iesus Christ himselfe, who could haue attained to monastical perfectnesse, if he had thought vpon or remembred to haue done workes of supererogation.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 I would also know of our Aduersaries, that do more then God will haue them to do and that by consequence exceede the commandement of God, if in doing those workes of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogation they do the will of God, or their owne. If they do the will of God, then they do no work of supererogation, but a necessarie worke. If they do their owne will, how dare they say that their will is perfecter then the will of God?</p>
                     <p n="6">6 If to do these superabundant works, God giueth them his Spirit and his assistance, then necessarily they are bound to do them, lest they should make the grace of God of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:11462:105"/> And so they should no more be workes of supereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, because they are bound to do them.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 But is not this to wrong the Law of God, which is the rule of righteousnesse, and to accuse it of imperfection, to go about to do perfecter workes then those which the Law commandeth? The righteousnesse of the Law is poore and miserable, is sinners can exceed it. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> there be rules of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction aboue the Law, what followeth, but that the Law is an imperfect rule?</p>
                     <p n="8">8 But is not this an intollerable pride to make Monkes profitable seruants of God, and <hi>Abraham, Iacob,</hi> and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> vnprofitable seruants, because they did none of those workes of supererogation?</p>
                     <p n="9">9 I am afraid that he which intrudes himselfe to do more seruice vnto God then he will haue him do, in the end will finde himselfe ill paid for his seruice. For, who required that at his hands? Where do we finde in the word of God the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of Monkes, and of their monasticall vowes?</p>
                     <p n="10">10 Compare these superabundant workes with those which God commands, and you shall finde much inequality in them. For the loue of God commanded in the Law is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes good and necessary: but the vow of single life is euill for those that haue not the gift of continencie 1. Corint. 7 9. <hi>For it is better to marry then to burne.</hi> To giue all our goods to the poore, is oftentimes a great sinne, if by that meanes we bereaue our children of them, deceiue our creditors, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inherite our right heires. Pietie doth not ouerthrow nature. 1. Tim. 5.8. <hi>He is worse then an infidell that hath not a care of his familie.</hi> Is pietie like a frenzie, which maketh a man forget Iustice? It may so happen that some men with hypocrisie or ambition will giue all their goods to the poore, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Cor. 13.3. saith. Adde hereunto, that Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s that make vowes of chastitie, pouertie, and obedience, are by experience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinced of the contrary. For the vow of chastitie makes them vnchaste, and abstinence from marriage pusheth them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to adultery. They make a particular vow of pouerty, to be rich in common, and follow a fat and idle kinde of beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:11462:106"/> in stead of a sober and vigilant labour. They make a vow of obedience to the rules of Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> or Saint <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius,</hi> and dispense with themselues for not obeying the commandements of God.</p>
                     <p n="11">11 Touching Martyrdome, there are two sorts, one which God calleth men vnto, the other, whereinto men rashly thrust themselues. God calleth men to martyrdome, when a man cannot saue his life, but by renouncing true Religion: Then martyrdome is a worke commanded; and so necessary, that without it, in that case, a man cannot be saued. It is not then a superabundant worke: it is not a counsell, but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. For God in his Law commandeth vs to loue him aboue all things; therefore more then our liues. In this case then, whosoeuer would saue his life shall lose his soule. He that shall deny Iesus Christ before men, Iesus Christ will deny him before his Father. But if martyrdome be vndertaken rashly, and if a man run into it without being called there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, then it is a transgression of the commandement of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, which saith, Matt. 10.23. <hi>When they persecute you in one citie, flie into another.</hi> And it is against Saint <hi>Paules</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, who to escape from his enemies, caused himselfe to be let downe in a basket out at a window in Damascus. Faith walketh betweene rashnesse and cowardise. In time of need it maketh the faithfull resolute to die, but it is not angry or vnwilling to liue. Withall, in martyrdome there are two things, the dolor and paine of the body, and the constancie and zeale of faith. The dolor of the body is not a vertue, but an exercise of vertue. Firme faith is a vertue commanded by God, &amp; not a perfection beyond the commandement of God.</p>
                     <p n="12">12 Adde vnto that a demonstratiue proofe, that is, that a good thing of it selfe is alwayes better then a thing that is not good but because of another thing. So life is better then meate, because meate is made to maintaine life. So it is with the loue of God commanded in the law, compared with these works of supererogation: For the loue of God is always holy, good, and necessarie. but to distribute our goods, or to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer martyrdome, is not good vnlesse it be done for the loue
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:11462:106"/> of God. If we ioyne these things together, the distribution of our goods to the poore is not good, but because men are moued thereunto for the loue of God. If you separate them, the loue of God alone is good and holy: but the distribution of our goods without the loue of God is a fault, an iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, and hypocrisie.</p>
                     <p n="13">13 The example which our Aduersaries take out of the nineteenth of Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> makes nothing for this abuse. A presumptuous yong man said, that he had kept Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements from his youth vpward: to whom Iesus Christ said, verse 21. <hi>If thou wilt be perfect, go sell that thou hast, and giue it to the poore, and thou shalt haue treasure in heauen.</hi> Our Aduersaries say, that Iesus Christ did onely counsell, and not command the yong man to sell all his goods, with a counsell of perfection; and that this treasure in heauen is a glorie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the ordinarie glorie of the Saints, promised to those, who hauing accomplished the Law, do something more, &amp; follow a greater perfection. To cleare this, we must know, that this yong man abused himselfe, and lyed, in boasting that he had accomplished the Law. For Iesus Christ accuseth him of putting his trust in his riches, Marke 10.14. And for forsaking Iesus Christ, and preferring his goods before Iesus Christ, he manifestly shewed his couetousnesse. He that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth his riches more then Iesus Christ, doth not loue him with all his heart, and with all his soule, and by consequence hath not accomplished the Law. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his 64. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milie vpon Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> saith, that he was couetous. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his 89. Epistle saith, That yong man answered more arrogantly then truly,<note place="margin">Ad Hilarium libr. <hi>4.</hi> de lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendis sacul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatibus. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

Seeing therefore that this man had not fulfilled the Law, it had bene in vaine for Iesus Christ to counsell him to do more then the Law: it had bene as much as if a man should set vp the weathercocke before the foundation be laid.</p>

                     <p>Iesus Christ, that knew his heart was set vpon his riches, gaue him that commandement, thereby to discouer his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarice, and to checke him for the same. And it is not to be doubted, that refusing to do that which Iesus Christ said vnto him, but he offended God. Whereas the Gospell saith, that Iesus Christ loued him, it doth not argue that he was without sinne: for Iesus loued Ierusalem, when he wept ouer it, and yet he accused it that it had slaine the Prophets. And dying for sinners, he shewed sufficiently that he loued them. It was then a compassionate loue that he shewed to that man, in whom he acknowledged some commendable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour, and some seedes of the feare of God.</p>

The question is, whether when we shall be in heauen, men that are on earth ought to pray vnto and call vpon vs. It is one thing to enquire or to seeke to know what the Saints do in heauen, and another thing to know what we should do here on earth. But <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> not vnderstanding the question, mixeth those two things together, which are much differing one from the other.</p>

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, that they should haue an exact knowledge of all particular things which are done here vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon earth, nor that they should know euery processe that is handled in Courts of Law, the troubles and businesse in a Faire, or for how much euery oxe is sold in a market. I speake not of many filthy &amp; dishonest things: as also of diuers other things which might trouble their blessednesse: as if a father should see the vices and afflictions of his children, one sent to the gallowes, another vpon a scaffold to be executed, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cast downe into hell, and another kneeling before an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to pray vnto it.</p>
                     <p>The holy Scripture makes it euident vnto vs <hi>Salomon</hi> in the 9. of Ecclesiastes, 5.6. saith, that <hi>the dead know not any thing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue they any more a reward.</hi> And a little after, <hi>Neither haue they any more a portion for euer in any thing that is done vnder the Sunne.</hi> And <hi>Iob</hi> 14.21, speaking of a father that is dead, saith, <hi>His sonnes come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are brought low, but he perceiueth it not.</hi> And 2. Kings. 22.20. God promiseth king <hi>Iosias,</hi> to let him go peaceably downe to his graue, that his eyes should not see the euill which God intended to bring vpon the Iewes.</p>
                     <p>Againe. If the Saints vnderstood our prayers, it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that they should know the imaginations of our hearts, to know whether we pray with a good affection. But the holy Scripture, 2. Chron. 6.30. saith, that <hi>God onely knoweth the hearts of the children of men.</hi> It is to no purpose to say that God onely of himselfe knows the hearts of men, &amp; that the Saints know them by reuelation: for besides that this is to diuine and affirme a thing which is vnknowne vnto vs, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Scripture speaketh not, in this distinction there is a contradiction. For they giue vs a reason why the Scripture saith, that the Saints know not our hearts, which is, because God hath giuen them vnderstanding to know them: they say, that they know not our thoughts, because God hath made them know them. As if I should say, I haue no money because you gaue me some: by the same reason I may say, that God
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:11462:109"/> onely knowes that Iesus Christ died for vs, because he knoweth it from, and by himselfe; but we know it not, but by reuelation. He that hath taught a thing to another man, cannot say that he onely knoweth it. I confesse that God sometimes reuealed the thoughts and counsels of some men vnto his Prophets: but that knowledge was seldome giuen vnto the Prophets, and onely in as much as it was necessary for the execution of their charge. And 2. Kings 4.47, <hi>Elisaeus</hi> saith that God had hidden the death of his hostesse the Suna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites sonne from him; how much more the hearts of all men? And by consequence, that cannot be alledged for the Saints that are dead, to whom God hath not giuen any charge in the Church. For to say that men giue the Saints charges and offices in Paradise, making one the protector of women in childbed, another a Physition to heale the toothach, another to cure horses, another Patron of a towne or a whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, is a thing no lesse absurd then if the flies should take vpon them to distribute and giue the charges and offices of the Empire of Rome to whom they would.</p>
                     <p>And this may serue also for answer to the argument drawne from the example of the Angels, amongst whom the Gospell teacheth vs, there is ioy for the conuersion of a sinner, Luke 15.10. God hath appointed the Angels to be gardians of the faithfull. Psal. 34.7. <hi>The Angell of the Lord encampeth round about them that feare him, and deliuereth them:</hi> and Heb. 1.14. <hi>They are ministring spirits, sent forth to minister for their sakes which shall be heires of saluation.</hi> It is no maruell then that God reuealeth vnto them the interior repentance of a sinner, and that they reioyce at the effects thereof which appeare out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>
                     <p>To thinke that the Angels and the Saints in the presence of God, know all things, or to say with Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> in the three and thirtieth chapter and fourth booke of his Dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues,<note place="margin">Quid est quod ibi nesciant, qui scientem omnia sciunt?</note> What know not they there, where they know him which knoweth all things? is to giue their rash coniectures for lawes, and without the word of God, to speake of that which is done in heauen, as if they came newly from thence:
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:11462:109"/> and it is contrary to the word of God. For Iesus Christ, Mat. 18.10. saith, that <hi>The Angels alwayes behold the face of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in heauen:</hi> and yet they know not when the day of iudgement shall be, Marke 13.32. By the publication of the Gospel they haue learned things which before they knew not. For Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Ephes. 3.10. speaking of the publication of the Gospell among the Gentiles, saith, that it was done, <hi>to the intent that the manifold wisedome of God might be made knowne vnto principalities and powers in heauenly places.</hi> Whereupon Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his first Epistle, 1.12. saith, that <hi>The Angels desire to see those things;</hi> as desiring to learne them.</p>
                     <p>Touching Pope <hi>Gregories</hi> words, they may well be borne withall, if he speake of the knowledge that the Saints haue of things belonging to their blessed state. But if he speake of a general knowledge of all things, his words are as full of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity; as if one shold say, that he which seeth <hi>Philip,</hi> necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily seeth all that which <hi>Philip</hi> sees. If standing on the ground I see a man vpon the top of a steeple, do I see all that which he seeth? If the sight of him that looketh, is to be measured ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the sight of him on whom he looketh, he that sees a blind man shall see nothing at all.</p>
                     <p>To be short, to affirme that the knowledge of the Saints should be of the like extent that the sight of God is, it is to make the creature infinite. For first, it is necessary that the Saints (in that respect) should know the infinitie of Gods essence, and in a finite spirit should containe an infinite knowledge: and also that in a moment they should know all things: and that Saint <hi>Nicolas</hi> in an instant should see all the thoughts of men, and vnderstand all their prayers. Things which repugne the essence of creatures, whose essence as it consisteth in a currant for a time, so the actions thereof are successiue, and are done one after another, and not all in a moment. The ancient Fathers speake of the state of the Saints, and of the memory of things which they haue seene and knowne in this life, and of the knowledge which they haue had of things here below, sometimes with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:11462:110"/> and some times doubtfully and vncertainly. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Licet possit dici, quod in coelo nouo, &amp; in terra noua, omnis conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sationis pristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae memoria deleatur, ne hoc ipsum pars malorum sit, prioris angu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiae recordari.</note> vpon the sixty fiue chapter of <hi>Esay</hi> saith, It may be said, that in the new heauen and in the new earth, all the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of forepassed conuersation is defaced: lest that the same might be an affliction vnto the Saints, to remember affliction past. And in the Epitaph for <hi>Nepotian</hi> he saith: We know that our friend <hi>Nepotian</hi> is with Christ, and in the company of the Saints.

                        <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> in his Orations maketh many apostro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phes, and sundry oratory compellations, not onely to the Saints that are dead but also to things without life. In his first Oration against <hi>Iulian,</hi> after he hath spoken to heauen and earth, he speaketh also to the soule of <hi>Constantine,</hi> dead long before, saying, * Hearken ô thou soule of great <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> if thou hast any feeling: not knowing whether he vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood him or not.

Yet he saith, that it may be that the dead know something that is done here on earth, by the report of those which die here and go vnto them: or that the Angels tell them somewhat, or that God reuealeth something vnto them, not all, but that onely which they must vnderstand.

                     <p>The word <hi>Aduocate</hi> is not in the place of the 1. to Tim. but it is found in Ioh. 2.1. his first Epistle. <hi>If any man sinne, we haue an aduocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the iust.</hi> It is from thence that our Confession hath taken the word <hi>Aduocate.</hi> And if that word were not there, yet by the word Aduocate we vnderstand nothing but a Mediator, which is the very word vsed by Saint <hi>Paul.</hi> Touching that which <hi>Master Arnoux</hi> saith, that the word <hi>mediator</hi> is an equiuocation, he accuseth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to haue equiuocated. He saith, that the word <hi>mediator</hi> may be taken for a mediator of intercession,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:11462:111"/> or for a mediator of redemption. But the coupling of these together, <hi>God is one, and the Mediator is one,</hi> confuteth this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction. For as the Apostle maketh not two sorts of Gods, so he alloweth not of two sorts of mediators towards God. If it be lawfull to make distinctions vpō the word <hi>Mediator,</hi> why not vpon the word <hi>God,</hi> and so to induce diuers Gods? For although we do not denie that the Saints pray for vs, yet they are not called mediators of intercession, because we call him the Mediator of intercession that receiueth our prayers to present them vnto God: which the Saints cannot do, because they vnderstand not our prayers, as we haue already proued.</p>
                     <p>Adde hereunto, that this distinction maketh the Saints to be but mediators of intercession, contrary to the Church of Rome, which beleeueth that the Saints do not onely mediate for vs, but also pay, merite, and satisfie for vs. Witnesse the doctrine of Indulgences or pardons, by the which the Pope distributeth vnto Christians the superabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the satisfactions of the Saints to serue thē to obtaine remission of sins before God. Witnesse also the Masse, which asketh saluation of God by the merits of the Saints,<note place="margin">Quorum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis precibus{que} rogamus, &amp;c.</note> as if they had merited for vs. Whereupon <hi>Bellarmine</hi> also in his first booke and fourth chapter of Indulgences, makes no difficulty to say, that <hi>the Saints in some sort are our redeemers.</hi>

                     <p>Whosoeuer knoweth what it is to be an Aduocate with God, knoweth also that the same tide belongeth not vnto the Saints. He is an Aduocate with God for vs, who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth our prayers, &amp; presenteth our requests to God, and accō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth them with his intercession. The Saints vnderstand not our prayers, as we haue already proued, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence cannot present them to God. And if they vnderstood our prayers, God hath receiued them before the Saints haue any leisure to ioyne their recommendations with them. And in the same place, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> hauing said that we haue an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate with God, addeth, <hi>For it is he which is the reconciliation for our sinnes:</hi> Shewing how he is our Aduocate, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he maketh reconciliation for our sinnes. Then to be an Aduocate for sinners, is to be their reconciliator; and if Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ be our onely reconciliator, then also he is our onely Aduocate.</p>
                     <p>Our Sauiour Iesus Christ decideth the question in manifest words, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.6. saying, <hi>I am that way, and that truth, and that life, no man cometh to the Father but by me.</hi> Then not by the Saints, nor by the intercession of creatures.</p>
                     <p>If the Saints be aduocates in heauen, who hath made them such? who hath receiued them for such? who commanded vs to pray vnto them? Haue children any need to vse inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors for them to speake vnto their fathers? And seeing that God frames and inspires our prayers, must we haue interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors to recommend that prayer vnto God which he himselfe hath put into our hearts and mouthes? If I present my prayer vnto God by the intercession of Iesus Christ onely, shall my
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:11462:113"/> prayer be lesse acceptable vnto God, then if I had employed the Saints to make intercession for me?</p>
                     <p>If we throughly consider of this matter, it will be found that our aduersaries seeking to go to God by the intercessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Saints, draw mens spirits into an endlesse labyrinth. For they say they go to God by meanes of the Saints, but in effect they go to the Saints by Gods meanes: for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse that God reuealeth our prayers to the Saints. Then they bring in God aduising the Saints, as if he should say to Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> Blessed Saint, know that such an one that liues be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in the earth in such a place, asketh such and such things of thee, whereof I tell thee, to the end that thou shouldest pray vnto me for him, and then I will take aduice whether I will heare thee or not. Which is an hatching of goodly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, which make God mediator to the Saints, rather then the Saints mediators to God.</p>
                     <p>Now if by the Saints we go to Iesus Christ, and if they be mediators to the Mediator, the prayers that we shall make to the Saints shall first go to God, and from God to the Saints, and from the Saints to Iesus Christ, and from Iesus Christ to God. A man that is in danger of drowning, may sinke foure times at the least before his prayer shall haue passed through so many hands.</p>
                     <p>And yet there is some difficultie, for before we make the Saints our mediators, we must be well assured that they are Saints. Now the church of Rome calleth vpon many Saints that neuer liued in the world; and many whose blessednesse may iustly be called in question.</p>
                     <p>The three Kings, Saint <hi>Longinus</hi> that pierced Christs side: Saint <hi>Martiall</hi> cosin to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that waited on the table when Iesus Christ celebrated the Eucharist, that draue Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan religion out of France, in the time of the Gothes, when there were no Gothes in France: Saint <hi>Vrsula</hi> daughter to the King of England (when there was no King in England) cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of an army of eleuen thousand Virgins: Saint <hi>Kathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi> daughter to <hi>Costus</hi> King of Alexandria, when there was no King in Alexandria, who in the Emperor <hi>Maxentius</hi>

The witnesses which they produce for their liues, are <hi>Ʋsuard, Simeon Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphrastus, Molanus, Euthymius,</hi> the Calendar of the Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and such new fabulous authors, which <hi>Baronius</hi> wholly contradicts. But no good ancient author that liued fiue hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares after the time which is named, wherein they say these imagined Saints should liue, doth speake of them. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi> maketh account that Saint <hi>George</hi> and Saint <hi>Christo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi> are symbolicall pictures, in the same sort that we paint the vertues: and yet men call vpon these Saints; and it is found that Saint <hi>George</hi> was an Arian Bishop, enemy to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasius.</hi> The like of Saint <hi>Margaret,</hi> whom the diuell swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed downe into his belly, and burst therewith, which is a kind of lying in childbed, and therefore they reade her Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gend to women lying in childbed. They make these Saints to liue vnder kings that neuer were; and in a time and in a country wherein there were no Martyrs, nor the name of Christianity knowne. They begin to be borne sixe or seuen hundred yeares after they died. There are a thousand absurd and ridiculous actions attributed vnto them.

And the booke of Sacred Ceremonies saith, that sometimes it happeneth that the Pope is constrained to

                        <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> will proue, that the Saints pray for vs in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, which is not in controuersie betweene vs. The Saints may pray generally for the Church, without knowing the thoughts and the necessities of particular persons.</p>
                     <p>But let vs see how he proues it. He produceth three places out of the Scripture, which speak of the prayers which the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing make one for another. Which is nothing to the purpose. For here the question is not touching the prayers of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, which God hath commanded to be made, &amp; which are made by those which particularly and mutually know our necessities. But the question is here touching the prayers which the Saints that are dead make for the liuing, whose particular necessities they know not, and we know not what commandement God hath giuen them touching the same. Moreouer when we recommend our selues to the mutuall prayers of the faithfull one for another, it is a reciprocall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie among vs, which is not so betweene vs and the Saints.</p>
                     <p>And withall, when we pray our neighbours to pray for vs, we do no religious seruice vnto them. We kneele not downe before them in the Church. We do not acknowledge them to be the searchers of our hearts. We esteeme them not to be our Patrons or gardians. We light not vp candles before them. We are well assured that they vnderstand vs when we speake vnto them. To be short, the prayer of the liuing one for another hath no affinity with the intercession and calling vpon dead Saints.</p>
                     <p>If a man should aske whether the liuing praying one for another may be called aduocates with God, I say, that the word of God giues them not that title, to the language or speech whereof it is requisite for vs to be conformable. It gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth that title to Iesus Christ onely, because that to be a mans aduocate, he must exactly know the cause, and the depth of a mans griefe: &amp; must not only intreate the Iudge for the party, but also debate and defend his parties cause to be iust and well grounded. Now there is none but Iesus Christ to whom this appertaineth. For men praying one for another, do
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:11462:115"/> not well know the ground of their neighbours griefe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they know not their hearts; nor the nature and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of their sinnes, nor of their repentance. And they cannot argue with God touching our cause, because they haue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to satisfie and pay for vs. Their prayer for vs is a simple supplication, and not an action of an Aduocate. There is no body but Iesus Christ who pleading our cause, can confute the diuels accusations, which is that accuser spoken of in the twelfth of the Reuelation, which accuseth vs day and night before God.</p>

                     <p>The question betweene vs and our aduersaries is twofold; one, whether the Saints know our hearts; the other, whether we must call vpon, and pray vnto them. These two questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> toucheth not, but moueth a third, which is not in controuersie, to know whether the Saints pray for vs in heauen.</p>
                     <p>This discourse, although from the purpose, is neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse stuffed with prety conceits: he saith, that the Saints should be hardly welcome into heauen, and but meanly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, if they had lost the credit that they had vpon earth. This diuinitie is delicate, and serues but for those that are of generous spirits, whereby he placeth Saints in Paradise,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:11462:116"/> that are not welcome thither. For it is certaine, that there are many Saints in Paradise that are vnknowne to vs; and many, that hauing liued holily, haue bene forgotten, or defamed after their deaths: in such manner, that it resteth in the power of the liuing to make a Saint, whether he be wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come or not into heauen. If men care not whether they serue them, and presently forget them, then it is maruell that such a Saint is suffered to enter into Paradise, and that the gate is not shut against him, seeing he cannot stand God in stead with his credit on earth. For Saint <hi>Peter</hi> at the gate might aske him, What account art thou of on earth? hast thou any of credit in thy country? For God hath need of Saints that are of credit among men. What should Saints do in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, to whom men burne no tapers on earth? Yet <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> will haue those Saints to enter therein, but to be hardly wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thither, and to receiue a disgrace at their entring into heauen. Therefore we haue reason to pittie <hi>Abraham, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> whose credits are much diminished, so farre as that at this day he should be laughed at that should say, Saint <hi>Moses,</hi> or Saint <hi>Abraham.</hi> They passe onely in the prease among the Patriarkes. No man makes any particular prayer vnto them. No man lights the least waxe candle that is before <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithfull. They speake of Saint <hi>Geneuesses</hi> and Saint <hi>Anthonies</hi> Masses, but not of Saint <hi>Moses</hi> nor of Saint <hi>Abrahams</hi> Masses. And euery Saint hath his charge, one of a sicknesse, another of a towne: but <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> neuer receiued any charge or commission from men. This also is iniurious against the Popes: for I see not that <hi>Innocent</hi> the fourth, <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight, nor <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the sixt, which were great men on earth, keepe their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits after their deaths.

                     <p>Our Confession condemneth the intercession of Saints, that is, it condemneth those which imploy them for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors, and pray them to be intercessors for them: which prayer is a religious worship. Now the Church of Rome commandeth the adoration of Saints and their reliques, but setteth downe distinctions of adoration, one proper to God, which they call <hi>Latria,</hi> the other (which is referred to Saints) they call <hi>Dulia;</hi> which are both religious worships, and an act of religion. For the inuocation of Saints which is vsed in the Church of Rome, is a part of the publike Seruice; and when men pray kneeling before their Images, they haue their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course vnto them, as to those to whom men owe a religious seruice, that know their hearts, and that haue power to heare them.</p>
                     <p>Against this abuse our Confession quoteth these three places of Scripture, wherein are condemned, the worship which <hi>Cornelius</hi> would haue giuen to <hi>Peter,</hi> that which the Lystrians would haue giuen to <hi>Paul,</hi> and that which <hi>Iohn</hi> would haue giuen to the Angell. In which places there is no mention made of two sorts of worshipping, but generally all religious worshipping of creatures is forbidden. And withall there is no apparence, that <hi>Cornelius</hi> a man which feared
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:11462:118"/> God, was so dull to thinke Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to be the soueraigne God, or that an equall honour (due to the soueraigne God,) belonged vnto him. Touching Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> that would haue adored the Angell, that spake vnto him, for the which the Angell rebuked him, saying, <hi>Take heede thou do it not, I am thy fellow seruant, worship God:</hi> you must know, that twise Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> would haue worshiped the Angell, one Reuel. 19.10. the other 22.9. And that after the first time that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell rebuked him, saying <hi>Worship God, I am thy fellow seruant,</hi> it is an euident proofe, that the second time when Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> would haue worshiped him, he knew well that it was not God, seeing the Angell told him so before: but being afraid, he would haue giuen him some inferiour worship, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse the Angell refused. If that Angell had bene a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Catholike, he would haue spoken to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in this manner: The worship which thou giuest me, is too high for me, I will be content with a meaner worship, and an adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dulia: for that of Latria belongeth onely vnto God. But the Angell had not learned so farre. So when the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe Diuines called the Arians Idolaters because they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Reade Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius in the life of S. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony.</note> whom they held to be but a creature; the Arians might well haue excused themselues by saying, that they worshipped Iesus Christ with an inferiour worship. But then they acknowledged but one religious worship, and that due to God onely.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Saint <hi>Iames</hi> the Apostle, 1.6. will haue vs <hi>to pray in faith and wauer not.</hi> But the prayer made to Saints cannot be made in faith, seeing that God hath not commanded it in his word. <hi>For faith is by hearing of the word of God,</hi> Rom. 10.17. Now that prayer vnto Saints is not commanded in the word of God, <hi>M. Cotton</hi> the Iesuite in the first booke of his Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the chapter of Inuocation of Saints, confesseth it saying: Touching a commandement to pray vnto, and to call vpon the Saints, the Church neuer taught that there was euer any such commandement. Then if it be not a commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, it is a commandement of men: seeing that in the publicke Seruice of the Romish Church, and in the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:11462:118"/> Letanies, the Saints are called vpon, the people are bound thereunto, and it is not in any particular mans power to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense with himselfe therein.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 10.14. maintaineth, that we cannot call vpon any other then on him in whom we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, saying; <hi>How shall they call on him, in whom they haue not beleeued?</hi> Our Creed teacheth vs to beleeue in God, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost. And <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.1. <hi>You beleeue in God, beleeue also in me.</hi> Then it is manifest, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> without exception reproueth all inuocation of creatures. And if any man will induce a second religious inuocation, he ought to proue it by the word of God.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 The same Apostle, Galat. 4.8. saith, <hi>Then when ye knew not God, ye did seruice vnto them which by nature are not gods.</hi> The Church of Rome seruing Saints and Angels, serueth those who by their nature are no gods. Now it is to be noted, that in the Greeke there is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that is to say, <hi>you giue Dulia,</hi> which is the seruice which the Church of Rome giueth vnto Saints. The Apostle reproueth the Galathians for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Dulia to any other but to God.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 The Scripture is full of places which command vs to addresse all our prayers vnto God. The Apostles desired Iesus Christ saying, <hi>Teach vs to pray,</hi> and he said vnto them,<note place="margin">Luke 11.1.2.</note>
                        <hi>When ye pray, say, Our Father which art in heauen.</hi> We must teach this lesson to those that pray vnto Saints, and say vnto them, <hi>When you pray, say, Our Father which art in heauen.</hi> God in the Psalme 50.15. saith, <hi>Call vpon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliuer thee:</hi> and in the same Psalme, verse 14. <hi>Offer vnto God thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing, and pay thy vowes vnto the most High.</hi> How many are there in the Church of Rome, that make vowes to Saints, or that vow to go on pilgrimage to them, or to offer vnto them? Deut. 6.13. <hi>Thou shalt feare the Lord thy God, and serue him, and shalt sweare by his Name.</hi> The Catechisme of the Councell of Trent teacheth the contrary, saying, We sweare by the crosse, by relickes, and by the names of Saints.<note place="margin">In the exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</note> To sweare by any one, is to acknowledge him to be a witnesse of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of our consciences, and a reuenger of periury; which
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:11462:119"/> agreeth not with relickes. To say, that swearing by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes of Saints, we sweare by God that loueth the Saints, is to accuse the Prophets &amp; the Apostles herein, that knowing well, that God loued <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> they did not sweare by their relickes. By the same reason I might worship the Sunne, and sweare by heauen, and say, that I do it to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God that made it.</p>
                     <p n="6">6 Iesus Christ, <hi>Matthew</hi> 4.10. said to Sathan, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by confuting Sathan, that offered him all the kingdomes of the world, if he would worship him. Who doubts not but that Sathan would haue bene content with an inferiour wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship? Our Sauiour might haue confuted Sathan by telling him of the dignitie of his person, as being the Sonne of God; or by shewing Sathan of his own indignity, as being the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall slaue or diuell in hell. But he chose rather to send him to that rule whereby all adoration of creatures is forbidden.</p>
                     <p n="7">7 But seeing that our aduersaries make two sorts of good workes, one commanded by God, the other onely counselled, and perfecter then those that are commanded, I would gladly know in what place they put the inuocation of Saints. For seeing that our aduersaries do acknowledge that God hath not commanded it, to be a good worke it must be counselled, and by consequence, the inuocation of Saints is a perfecter worke then calling vpon God. In the meane time there is no man so brutishly superstitious, that seeing two men kneeling on their knees, whereof the one prayeth vnto God, the other to Saint <hi>Francis,</hi> but will confesse, that he which prayeth vnto God, doth a better worke then the other.</p>
                     <p n="8">8 Particularly for the inuocation and seruice of Angels, we haue an expresse passage of the Apostle, Colossians 2.18. <hi>Let no man at his pleasure beare rule ouer you by humble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of minde, and worshipping of Angels, aduancing himselfe in those things which he neuer saw.</hi> Let men as much as they will diuine the meaning of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this place, yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that he generally prohibiteth the seruice of Angels, and by consequence that which is practised in the Church of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:11462:119"/> Rome. And in the Church of the old Testament, when An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels appeared vnto men, and visibly did those messages and commissions wherein God employed them, yet the faithfull neuer did ordaine any religious seruice to be done vnto them. In all the publike Seruice prescribed in the bookes of <hi>Moses,</hi> there is nothing spoken of any seruice done to Angels in the Tabernacle. And I would gladly know why now, when their ayde is lesse sensible, they ought rather to be serued and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vpon. <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his commentarie vpon this place, saith, Those that forbad the Law, induced them so to serue Angels, saying, that the Law was giuen by their interposition. This vice continued a long time among them of Phrygia and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidia. Therefore the Synode assembled in Laodicea, the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall citie of Phrygia, by expresse ordinance forbad them to pray vnto Angels; and yet at this day we see among them and their neighbours Oratories or Chappels to pray in to S. <hi>Michael:</hi> which those that maintained them, said they did in humilitie, saying that the God of the whole world is inuisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, incomprehensible, and vnaccessible; and therefore that they had need to make God fauorable vnto them by Angels. And that is it which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> said, in humblenesse and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of Angels. There are three things to be noted in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent place. The first, that <hi>Theodoret</hi> beleeued that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Laodicea forbad prayer to Angels. The second that he condemned the Chappels made to pray to S. <hi>Michael,</hi> which neuerthelesse are vsed in the Romish Church. The third, that those heretickes whereof he speaketh, vsed the same words that the Church of Rome doth, which is, that to make God fauourable vnto them, they haue their recourse to Angels and Saints, with deuotion and humilitie of spirit. <hi>Baronius</hi> is angrie, and chideth <hi>Theodoret</hi> for writing in this manner, in the first Tome of his Annals in the sixetieth yeare.<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>The ordinarie excuse is, that men haue accesse to God by the Saints and Angels, as they haue accesse to kings by their officers and attendants. But the case is not all one.

Should not the voyce of the Spirit of God speaking in our hearts be pleasing vnto God? Besides that we haue already shewed our aduersaries do cleane contrary ro that which they say, and haue recourse by God to the Saints.

                     <p>This is the place according to the Greeke: <hi>I will indeuour therefore alwayes, that ye also may be able to haue remembrance of these things after my departing.</hi> This word <hi>may</hi> in Greeke is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                        </gap>, which signifieth <hi>to haue meanes.</hi> Yong scholers that haue but a little vnderstanding in Greeke, may easily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that this is the sence of the Greeke in the Apostle. And if it were so that we had no vnderstanding of the Greek at all, the whole sence of the place it selfe forceth vs to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand it so. For Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the verses before, and also in this, yeeldeth a reason vnto the faithfull why he wrote vnto them, which was, that perceiuing himselfe to be neare his death, he would leaue a remembrance of his instructions, that they might haue a meanes after his death often to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that which he had said vnto them in his life time. This is the whole place: <hi>For I thinke it meete as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stirre you vp, by putting you in remembrance, seeing I know that the time is at hand that I must lay downe this
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:11462:122"/> abernacle, euen as our Lord Iesus hath shewed me. I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour therefore alwayes, that ye also may be able to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of these things after my departing.</hi> And so the greatest part of our aduersaries which haue translated or written Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries vpon this Epistle vnderstand it, as <hi>Arias Monta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> Cardinall <hi>Caietan,</hi> the ordinary Glosse. And aboue all, <hi>Thomas</hi> the Prince of Schooles,<note place="margin">Quia cito transiturus, ideo dum viuo dabo operam vos cōmonen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, non solum semel, sed &amp; frequenter, id est, instanter &amp; diligenter, habere vos, id est, vt habeatis memoriam praedictorum post obitum meum.</note> is very formall in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary vpon this Epistle: Because (saith he) that I must soone depart, therefore while I liue I will indeuour my selfe by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertising you not onely once, but often times also, that is to say, instantly and diligently, that you may haue a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the things aforesaid after my death. <hi>Oecumenius</hi> saith, that this exposition is the plainest, and that the other is hyperbaticall that is to say, ouerthrowing and troubling the construction.</p>
                     <p>Neuerthelesse, if it were as true, as it is false and absurd, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> promised the faithfull to pray for them after his death, what is that to the purpose? If Saint <hi>Peter</hi> being in heauen prayeth for the Church, doth it follow that we ought to call vpon him? doth it follow that he knowes our hearts?</p>

                     <p>It was not needfull to note places in the Margent against Purgatorie, nor against Monasticall vowes, pilgrimages, prohibition of marriage and of meates, auricular confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and Indulgences or pardons, because the places no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the margent of the fifth Article of our Confession, where humane traditions are condemned, and the perfection of the Scriptures proued, are sufficient to ouerthrow and confute these points, which are humane traditions inuented
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:11462:123"/> for gaine and for ambition. Besides, the margent had not bene great enough to confute so many points briefly tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in one Article.

                     <p>Touching the cutting off of the Canonicall books where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are accused, I haue heretofore sufficiently satisfied the Reader therein, and cleared our Churches of that slander.

                     <hi>Baille</hi> the Iesuite, in his Catechisme of Controuersies, and <hi>Cotton</hi> the Iesuite, in his Institutions, say, That Purgatorie is a prison or gaole, and a place vnder the ground, aboue hell where the damned are, where the soules that are laden and defiled with veniall sins, and which haue not here on earth satisfied the diuine Iustice, are purged by that temporall fire. Yet they make that fire to be as hote as that in hell, and very long; witnesse the pardons of diuers thousands of yeares.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine is cruell, and beareth her condemnation in her forehead. For our aduersaries will haue:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God which hath giuen his Sonne to die for the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:11462:123"/> redemption of his enemies, taketh pleasure to burne his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for their sinnes already pardoned, and for the which Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ hath made satisfaction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 That God tormenteth his elect in a fire, not for their amendment (for they are iustified already before they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thereinto,) but to satisfie himselfe, and to content his iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice. No father euer punished his children in such manner.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 That God, to satisfie his iustice, exerciseth iniustice, taking two payments for one selfesame debt, and two satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions for one sinne, that is, the passion of Iesus Christ, and the paines of Purgatory; although the first satisfaction, which is the passion of Iesus Christ, is most sufficient, as well for Purgatorie as for hell.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 That the passion of Iesus Christ being sufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt vs from Purgatorie as well as from hell, neuerthelesse God accepteth not the passion of his Sonne for as much as it is worth, but closeth his hand, and restraineth his libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, and cutteth off some of the worth of Iesus Christs death, that his children may not be exempted from torment.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 That the passion of Iesus Christ is applied vnto vs by burning and tormenting vs for many yeares; which is to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the mercie of God by the execution of his iustice, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply pardon by punishment, to apply the remissiō of our debts, by making vs pay them: and briefly, to apply the benefit and grace of Iesus Christ, by a means derogating from this grace, and contrary to that benefit.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 That Iesus Christ making intercession in heauen for all the faithfull, their burning soules come not out of that fire by his intercession, but that they come forth by the Popes pardons.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 That the Pope hauing power to draw more soules out of that fire then he doth, yet he that boasteth himselfe to be the common father of Christians, lets them burne therein many yeares.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 That the soules entring into Purgatorie, are already pure and without sinne, and yet haue need of purgation: for the fault remaineth no more, and yet neuerthelesse they say
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:11462:124"/> it hath need to be purged. So purgatorie is made to purge soules that are pure without sinne, and to cleanse filthinesse of sin which is no more in them.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 That sins pardoned are purged by torment, as if a man should call a whip, a wheele, or a gibet a purgation.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 That sins fully pardoned, are punished in this fire, and that God hauing fully defaced and taken away the fault, makes them endure paine that haue no more fault, and were no more culpable. As if God said vnto vs I forgiue thee all thy sins, but thou shalt be punished in a fire. I forgiue thee all thy debt, but not the payment of the debt: for our sins are debts, whereof the punishment is the payment. Certainly pardon is no other thing, then not to punish. And a guiltie person would be very well content that the King should not forgiue him his fault, so he would remit the punishment. Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ tooke our sins vpon him, to the end that we should be discharged of the punishment. It were in vaine for him to haue made full satisfaction for vs, if he had not discharged vs.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 That God will haue vs fully and freely to pardon our neighbours, and holdeth him for a wicked man, that hauing bene iniured by his neighbour would pardon his offence, but neuerthelesse would determine to make him endure punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for it. Whereby it followeth, that God will haue vs to be more mercifull then himselfe: seeing that our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries say, that after God hath pardoned all our offences, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs suffer and endure satisfactory punishments in a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fire many yeares.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 All these abuses spring from a peruerse maxime which subuerteth all the Gospell, which is, that Iesus Christ by his death exempteth vs from satisfactory punishments, due for sins committed before Baptisme, but not for satisfactory pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments due for sins after Baptisme. A maxime, whereof there is not one word found in the Scripture: which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse ought to be more clearely set downe therein then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other doctrine, seeing that to know what Iesus Christ hath done for vs, is that which makes vs Christians. It is the
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:11462:124"/> soule and foundation of Christian religion.</p>
                  <p>All that which is said before, is an entrance and an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to that which followeth.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 That the Pope, by vertue of that which Iesus Christ said to <hi>Peter, Whatsoeuer thou shalt loose or vnbinde vpon earth, &amp;c.</hi> looseth or vnbindeth also vnder the earth, and can deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer soules out of Purgatorie. And by that power, he giueth fiue or sixe hundred thousand yeares of pardon, and erecteth priuiledged Altars, whereon whosoeuer saith a Masse vpon a certaine day, at his choice or pleasure draweth a soule out of Purgatorie; and priuiledgeth certaine persons, to whom he granteth, either not to enter at all into Purgatory, or to come presently out againe. Those are the white Friers, who boast that they haue a priuiledge to be no longer in Purgatorie, then till Saterday next ensuing after their deaths: and the Franciscan or gray Friers, to whom Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fifth granted a free pardon; and the deliuering of a soule out of Purgatorie, for saying of certaine Pater nosters mixed with Aue Maries on Satterday before Palme Sunday, and on the feast day of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptist, and of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> Port-latine. In the Treasure of Indulgences of the Franciscan or gray Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, printed in Roan, these words are found; For euery day,<note place="margin">By Thomas Dare in the Iewes street neare the Pallace, 1614. pag. 119.</note> vntill the natiuitie of our Lady, there are 862000 yeares and 100 dayes of pardon and remission of the third part of sinnes granted. The booke of Roman Indulgences speaketh of much more.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 To that end there is a great trafficke made of pardons, and the Cleargie by that meanes sucke and draw vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues the substance and treasure of the Laitie, liuing vpon the ignorant feare of poore people, who dying, thinke themselues to be easily quit of the punishment in hell, if they may onely remaine in a burning fire for the space of some hundreds of yeares: and for that cause bereaue their children and their heires, of their goods, to giue it vnto those that weepe not, but to such as laugh and sing; not to those that want and haue need thereof, but to rich and idle Monkes. For rich men they say diuers Masses and Trentals, for which
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:11462:125"/> they pay deare, thereby (as they say) to ease and comfort their soules in that torment; but for the poore, or those that giue them nothing, they neuer say any particular Masses. They die good cheape. They must content themselues with generall prayers, whereof neuerthelesse rich men also haue a part. Towards the poore they will haue God to vse the rule of the Gospell, which is, Verily I say vnto thee, thou shalt not come out thence vntill thou hast payd the vttermost far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.26.</p>

And in his 12. second booke of the Citie of God, chapter 9. he saith, That part of the citie of God, that should be ioyned to the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Angels, being an assembly of mortall men, is, either a pilgrimage on earth in a mortall condition, or as touching those that are dead, consisteth in the hidden receptacles and seates of the soules.

And yet neuerthelesse, as well in <hi>Chrysostome</hi> as in <hi>Augustine,</hi> there are places found, which say, That the soules of the faithfull leauing their bodies, go straight to Iesus Christ, and see God face to face.

The Canon of the Masse prayeth for the dead in these termes: Remember ô Lord thy seruants which sleepe in the slumber of peace. For when that prayer was hatcht, they did not beleeue that the soules of the children of God were tormented in a fire.</p>
                  <p>Many did not beleeue that the soules should come out of those receptacles, all at one time, &amp; that some should not rise so soone as others, that is, such as were heauier laden with sinnes, which should be punished by the delaying of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. <hi>Modicum quodque delictum mora resurrectionis luen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do:</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the last chapter of his book of the Soule saith.

                  <p>But I find the Fathers to agree in nothing more then in this opinion, that as soone as the dead shall be risen, they shall be singed and burnt by the fire of the day of iudgement, which they call a Baptisme of fire, &amp; the flaming sword at the entrie of Paradise, from which fire they exempt no man, no not the Apostles, nor the virgine <hi>Marie.</hi>

                  <p>Such is the Purgatory of the ancient Fathers, and not a fire vnder the ground, where the soules of the faithfull should be burnt before the day of iudgement for sinnes that are pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, nor a prison whereof the Pope is the Iaylour. And all the seruice and the prayers for the dead which are said in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Church, do not in any sort speake of the fire of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, but of the sleeping of the soule, and that it is not cast into eternall fire. So the Greeke Churches pray for the dead, and deny Purgatory. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in the heresie of <hi>Aerius,</hi> and <hi>Denis</hi> in the booke of the Ecclesiasticall Hierarchie spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of prayer for the dead, and neuerthelesse presupposeth that the dead for whom they pray are already in rest and blessednesse. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his booke of the Care for the dead, approueth prayer for the dead, but in all that booke speaketh not one word of Purgatory. The second booke of <hi>Machabees,</hi> chapter 12. commendeth prayer for the dead, when in that prayer men haue a regard vnto the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: that is to say, when we pray for one that is dead, that he may rise to saluation, but not to draw him out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. The Ancients prayed and gaue gifts, and made offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for the dead to the end aforesaid, to wit, for the quiet resting of soules, for the resurrection, and that the dead may rise one of the first, and to the end that he may be friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled by the purging fire of the day of iudgement, but neuer to draw a soule out of Purgatory. And to conclude: in all antiquity there is no mention made of priuiledged altars, whereon he that causeth a Masse to be said, draweth a soule out of Purgatorie at his choise, nor of pardons giuen by the Pope to the dead.</p>
                  <p>In the time of Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the first, that wrote in anno
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:11462:129"/> 595, Sathan hatched that which the ages ensuing haue dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed. For by the fourth booke of Dialogues written by this Pope, you may see that then they placed Purgatory in the wind, in the smoke of bathes, and in riuers. At last Purgatory was put vnder the ground and placed neare to hell. <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> in his second booke of Purgatogy and sixt chapter saith, That in a manner all the Doctors are of one accord, that the damned and the soules in Purgatory are in one selfe same place, and are tormented all alike. And yet when the soules come out of that fire, they will not haue them presently to enter into Paradise. For <hi>Beda,</hi> and after him <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the seuenth chapter of his first booke of Purgatory, will haue the soules when they come out of that fire, to refresh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, for a while in a medow full of flowers which is neare to that place. Which is a subiect of profound speculation, as if there were greene medowes full of flowers in the conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities vnder ground, where there is no Sunne: and as if the soules could smell flowers, then who mowes those medowes? This fabulous doctrine, forged to enrich the Clergie, and to affright the consciences of the ignorant, let vs further exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine by the word of God.</p>

<pb n="221" facs="tcp:11462:129"/> saluation, but not to draw them out of Purgatory. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, there it is said, that if <hi>Iuda</hi> had not hoped that the dead should rise againe, it had bene a superfluous thing, and full of follie, to pray for the dead. Then the prayer for the dead, which is made in the Romish church, by the iudgement of the Author of that booke, is foolish, because it is not made in hope, or with any regard of the resurrection, but to pull mens soules out of a burning fire.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The holy Scriptures giue vs many examples of men, that when they died entred into blessednes, Luk. 2.29. <hi>Simeon</hi> made his account to enter into rest by his death saying, <hi>Lord now lettest thou thy seruant depart in peace, according to thy word.</hi> Luke 16.22. <hi>Lazarus</hi> soule is by Angels carried into <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> bosome, where it is comforted, while the wicked rich man was tormented.

At the least, if they want rules, let them find one onely example of a soule that is sent to that fire: But they neither produce examples nor rules. But on the contrary we produce a whole age, wherein all those that shall liue, shall be exempted from Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, that is, those that shall be aliue in the world, when the day of iudgement shall happen.

Where also we haue shewed how S. <hi>Iohn</hi> in his first Epistle, 1.7, saith, <hi>That the bloud of Iesus Christ cleanseth vs from all sinne.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> Col. 2.13. saith, <hi>That God hath freely forgiuen vs all our trespasses.</hi> He saith <hi>all</hi> and <hi>freely,</hi> to the end to exclude all satisfaction on our parts to the Iustice of God. For if we must satisfie the Iustice of God by our torments, we can neuer make satisfaction for the least part of our sinnes, for that God receiueth no satisfaction but that which is most exact and complete; for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture telleth vs, <hi>that he which shall call his brother foole shall be punished with hell fire,</hi> Matth. 5.22. And <hi>that no railers shall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herite
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:11462:130"/> the kingdome of God,</hi> 1. Cor. 6.10. faults wherewith euen the better sort of Christians are sometimes ouertaken.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 The proofes drawne from the definition are demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue. Then to know whether God pardoneth our offences without any satisfying punishments on our behalues, we must know what it is to pardon. I say, that to pardon, is to remit the penalty or punishment deserued and not to impose any satisfying punishments, nor to take any vengance or reuenge. Now God forgiueth vs all our offences, and doth it freely; therefore he expecteth no punishment, nor satisactory paines from vs.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 God also is a most gracious Father. Now a father, (if he be not altogether vnnaturall) neuer correcteth his children to draw any satisfaction from them, but giueth correction to amend them. The afflictions of this present life serue to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend vs, and not to appease his wrath. But the torments of Purgatory serue not to amend a sinner, seeing that there the soules sinne no more. They will haue them onely to serue to satisfie the iustice of the Iudge. Then they are not corrections of a father, but punishments of an angrie Iudge.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 All satisfactory punishment is a satisfaction for a fault. Now when the fault is wholly remitted, there is no more sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory punishment to be endured.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 And all purgation is to cleanse some filthinesse or spot: but in the fire of Purgatory no spots or filthinesse are purged; for paine is not a spot nor a filthinesse, but the fault. Then the fault being abolished and pardoned, what is there to be purged?</p>
                  <p n="13">13 To say that after the king hath pardoned a man he will haue him to make satisfaction to the partie offended, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpose. For the king and the partie are two. But here the king which is God, is also the partie, who being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, and hauing remitted all his right, there resteth no more parties to be contented, nor satisfaction to be made vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to iustice.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 To say that the benefit of Iesus Christs passion is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied vnto vs by burning and tormenting vs in a fire, it is not
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:11462:131"/> onely to speake without authority of the Scripture, but also to contrary the Scripture, which saith, Heb. 1.3. <hi>That Iesus Christ hath himselfe purged our sinnes.</hi> Then not by a fire, not by the tormenting of soules, which he hath bought with so great a price.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 Touching the ease and comfort which the soules in Purgatory receiue by the prayers of the liuing, Ecclesiastes 95.6, saith, <hi>That the dead haue not any more reward, neither haue they any more portion for euer in any thing that is done vnder the Sunne.</hi> Therefore God who in his Law ordained sacrifices and purifications for all sorts of sinnes and corporall filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, euen for the Leaper, and for touching or handling of the dead, ordained not any sacrifice nor propitiation for the dead.</p>
                  <p n="16">16 Neuerthelesse, to maintaine this fire, our aduersaries gather heapes of straw, that is, some small and light places out of the Scripture, whereat I wonder how they can be so ill aduised, seeing that the same places are of no value for their purpose. They alledge Luk. 12.58.59. which saith, <hi>While thou goest with thine aduersarie to the ruler, as thou art in the way, giue diligence in the way, that thou maist be deliuered from him, lest he draw thee to the Iudge, and the Iudge deliuer thee to the Iaylor, and the Iaylor cast thee into prison. I tell thee thou shalt not depart thence, till thou hast paid the vtmost mite.</hi> And Matth. 5.25, saith, <hi>Agree with thine aduersary quickly,</hi> in steed of these words, <hi>Giue diligence in the way that thou maist be deliuered from him.</hi> Our aduersaries will haue the way to signifie life, the Magistrate God, &amp; the prison the fire of Purgatory, the aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie the diuell: and by consequence they would haue vs to agree with the diuell. And if in this place it is meant that the diuell is the aduersarie, who shall be the executioner? And are we in the way with the diuell? for Saint <hi>Matthew saith, Agree with thine aduersary quickly whilest thou art in the way with him.</hi> For these causes some of them will haue the diuel to be the sergeant, &amp; the Law the aduersarie; which is yet worse. For doth the diuell draw the faithfull into Purgatory? Are we in the way with the Law? Is the Law of God our enemy? Are
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:11462:131"/> we to seek meanes to deliuer our selues from it, and to shake off the yoake thereof? For Saint <hi>Luke</hi> saith, that we must giue diligence in the way, that we may be deliuered from our aduersarie. And what absurditie is it, to call a prison a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fornace? And how is Purgatorie a prison, from whence the soules shall not come forth, till they haue paid the last far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, seeing that the Pope, by pardons, taketh soules from thence before satisfaction is fully accomplished? And, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit we should receiue and allow of their Allegories for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations, and according to the sence which it pleaseth them to giue them, yet in the end they must proue that this Purgatorie is a fire, and not a water or a field couered ouer with snow, wherein the soules wash, or roll and turne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues; for in this place there is no more spoken of fire then of water.</p>
                  <p>The sence of this place is cleare and manifest. Iesus Christ exhorteth vs to peace and concord with our neighbours that trouble vs, and counselleth vs, not to wrangle and striue with them in law. That is the counsell which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> giueth, 1. Cor. 6.4. to end our controuersies, rather by the aduice and arbitration of brethren of the Church, then to go to law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Iudges that are infidels. So Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> expoundeth the twelfth of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> where he saith, that Iesus Christ speaketh,<note n="*" place="margin">De reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianda pace dissidentium fratrum.</note>
                     <hi>To make peace betweene brethren that are at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

But <hi>Berradius</hi> the Iesuite, and Cardinall <hi>Tolet</hi> vpon the twelfth of Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> expound this place as we do.</p>
                  <p>Some alledge these words of the Apostle, 1. Corin. 15.29. <hi>What shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all?</hi> From whence they inferre, with incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable subtiltie, that therefore there must needes be a Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie.
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:11462:132"/> To proue Purgatorie in that sort, is silently to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, that there is none. By <hi>being baptized</hi> they vnderstand, <hi>to be afflicted:</hi> from whence they inferre, <hi>that to be afflicted,</hi> signifieth, <hi>to afflict our selues, to fast, to whip our selues, and to pay for Masses to be said for the dead.</hi> For, whosoeuer (say they) afflicteth himselfe, and doth penall workes for the dead, presupposeth that there is a fire of Purgatorie. I thinke, that saying so, they do not thinke that they shall be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued; and none of the ancient Fathers euer expounded this place in that manner. For although that sometimes afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are called a Baptisme, yet it shall neuer be found, that to be baptized signifieth that a man should afflict himselfe. As also, that whosoeuer afflicteth himselfe for a dead man, doth not necessarily suppose that he is in a fire. Can he not afflict himselfe, shead teares, and pray, to the end he may obtaine Gods fauour, that the dead shall rise againe to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? which is the end of the prayer for the dead, which is spoken of in the second booke of the Maccabees chapter 12. And why should he that afflicteth himselfe for a dead man, be more bound to beleeue that the dead man is rather in a fire then in water?</p>
                  <p>Touching the true sence of this place, I confesse that it is one of the obscure places in the Scripture, whereby God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciseth our sobrietie. Yet I will speake that which I thinke to be most probable.<note place="margin">

This <hi>Cerinthus</hi> liued in the Apostles time, if we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and vsed many meanes to oppose against them, and to hinder their preaching. Of these heretickes <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> in the heresie of the Cerinthians, which is the eight, saith, That when any of them dyed without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, they baptized some other man in the name of the dead person, fearing lest he should be punished at the day of the resurrection, because he died without baptisme. Against these heretickes, who denying the resurrection of
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:11462:132"/> Iesus Christ, silently made the generall resurrection doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, <hi>Epiphanius</hi> esteemeth that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in this place dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puteth, and seeketh to confute them by themselues, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That if according to the doctrine of those false Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, the dead should not rise againe, how cometh it, that among them liuing men are baptized for the dead that were not baptized, to the end, that the baptisme of the liuing man receiued, for, and in the name of the dead man, might be profitable vnto that dead man in the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection?<note place="margin">Si autē et bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizantur qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam pro mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuis, videbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus an ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne; certè illa praesumptione hoc eos insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuisse conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, qua alij etiam vicari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um baptismae profuturum existimarent ad spem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrectionis.</note> So the Apostle sheweth them that they contradict themselues. This exposition is confirmed by <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in the eight and fortieth chapter of his booke of the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the flesh; How (saith he) are they baptized for the dead? Certainly he maintaineth that they ordained this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, grounded vpon this opinion, whereby they thought that baptisme receiued for another, should be profitable to an other body for the assurance of the Resurrection. From thence the Marcionites brought vp a custome, to put a liuing man vnder the bed wherein a dead man lay that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without Baptisme, and then asked the dead man, and said; Wilt thou be baptized? whereunto the liuing man hidden vnder the bed, made answer and said: I will; as <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> in his fortieth Homilie vpon the first Epistle to the Corinthians saith.</p>
                  <p>The place wherewith they make the greatest shew is the 12. chap. of S. <hi>Mathew</hi> 32. verse, where Iesus Christ speaking against the sin of the holy Ghost, saith, <hi>It shall not be forgiue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> him, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.</hi> The world to come, (our Aduersaries say) is the fire of Purgatorie. But how is that possible? seeing that (if we may beleeue it) Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorie was before Christ was borne? And why should that world to come rather be a fire then water, or ice? for there is no mention made neither of the one nor of the other. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that, how will they haue that world to come wherein sinnes are pardoned, to be Purgatorie, seeing that Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is a torment and a punishment? and that (according to their doctrine) sinne is pardoned before the soules enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Purgatorie?</p>
                  <pb n="228" facs="tcp:11462:133"/>
                  <p>The sence of this place is cleare, not to pardon sinne is to punish it. Then Iesus Christ declareth that God will pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the sin against the holy Ghost in this life, and at the day of Iudgement, which is called the other world <hi>Luke</hi> 20.35. <hi>Those that shall be counted worthy to enioy that world, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They also alledge the first of the Corinthians, 3.11.12.13.14.15. where Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>For other foundation can no man lay then that which is layd, which is Iesus Christ. And if any man build on this foundation, gold, siluer, precious stones, timber, hay or stubble, euery mans worke shall be made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, for the day shall declare it, because it shall be reuealed by fire, and the fire shall trie euery mans worke of what sort it is: If any mans worke abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receiue wages: If any mans worke burne; he shall lose, but he shall be saued himselfe, yet so as it were by fire.</hi> Our Aduersaries will haue this fire to be Purgatorie.</p>
                  <p>I answere, first, That we can ground no doctrine vpon allegoricall places: Secondly, That seeing our Aduersaries vnderstand the words, wood hay, stubble, or siluer, allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rically, there is no reason to take the onely word <hi>Fire</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly; specially seeing that that is the onely word where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Apostle putteth the note of a similitude, saying, <hi>He shall be saued yet</hi> as <hi>it were by fire.</hi> Thirdly, adde hereunto, that here he speaketh of a fire which trieth the worke, and not of a fire which punisheth the person. Fourthly, of a fire whereby the worke shalbe made manifest: but what is done in Purgatorie is not manifest. Fiftly, <hi>Of euery mans worke:</hi> then of the Apostles and the Martyrs workes, whom neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse the church of Rome exempts from purgatorie. Sixtly, also here it is spoken of a fire wherein the worke burneth, &amp; not soules. Seuenthly, of a fire whereby the workeman loseth his worke, but in Purgatorie nothing is lost. And if men will say that sinnes therein are lost, there is a benefit in that losse.</p>
                  <p>The sence of the place is plaine. The Apostle speaketh of Pastors and Doctors, which teaching retaine the foundation which is Iesus Christ, whereupon some build holy and firme
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:11462:133"/> doctrines, which are called gold, siluer, and precious stones; other build vaine and light doctrines, which degenerate from the price and soliditie of the foundation; and are called wood, hay, and stubble. The Apostle saith, that those light do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, examined by the word of God as mettals by fire, shall not subsist; that the worke of such a Minister shall perish, and that proofe shall manifest and make knowne, that there is no firmenesse in it. But touching the person of the Pastor, although his worke perisheth, yet he may be saued, because of the foundation which he hath holden. But yet after a triall of his worke hath bene made, as mettals are tried by fire. Therefore here the Apostle speaketh of a triall that shall be made in this life, and not afterward; and of a triall of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Pastors, and not of tormenting of soules in a fire.</p>
                  <p>Some make a shew of the place of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Philip. 2.10. <hi>That at the name of Iesus should euery knee bow, both of things in heauen, and things in earth, and things vnder the earth.</hi> And of that which is said, Reuel. 5.13. <hi>And all the creatures which are in heauen, and on the earth, and vnder the earth, and in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Praise, and honour, and glory and power, be vnto him that sitteth vpon the throne, and vnto the Lambe for euermore, &amp;c.</hi> With these places our adue saries blow this imaginarie fire, saying, that those that are vnder the earth are the soules that are tormented in Purgatory. They ought also to tell vs, what those creatures are which are in the sea: and also shew vs a reason, why by those that are vnder the earth, they will sooner vnderstand soules in Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory, then the soules of little children that died before they were baptized; because they place thē also vnder the ground. But there is much more apparence and likelihood, that by those which are vnder the earth, is vnderstood those whose bodies are in the graues, or those that are in hell: for all men both good and bad shall bow their knees before Iesus Christ at the day of iudgement, and shall humble themselues in his presence. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in that place to the Philippians speaketh of the kingdome giuen to Iesus Christ ouer all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures without exception. As also in Rom. 14.10.11, where
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:11462:134"/> God saith thus, <hi>For we shall all appeare before the iudgement seate of Christ. For it is written, I liue (saith the Lord) and euery knee shall bow to me, and all tongues shall confesse vnto God.</hi> In this place it is plaine, that the Apostle taketh, <hi>Appeare before the iudgement seate of Christ, and to bow the knee before God;</hi> for one selfe same thing. To kindle this imaginary fire, they yet bring a match which will not take light, that is, the 21. chap. of the Reuelation, 27 ver. where the Spirit of God speaking of the celestiall Ierusalem, saith: <hi>And there shall enter into it no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane thing.</hi> From whence they infer, that the soules of the faithfull that are spotted with sinne, ought to be purged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they enter into Paradise. But the words following shew, that by <hi>the vncleane,</hi> is not vnderstood the faithfull spotted with sinne, but the wicked and the abhominable. This is the whole place: <hi>And there shall enter into it no vncleane thing, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther whatsoeuer worketh abhomination or lies, but they which are written in the Lambes booke of life.</hi> Then those <hi>vncleane</hi> are the abhominable and liers, and such as are not written in the booke of life. Not therefore the soules of the faithfull, which haue no need to be put in the crurible or into the fire to be purified. <hi>For the bloud of Iesus Christ purgeth them from all sinne.</hi> 1. Ioh. 1.7.</p>
                  <p>The rest of the places which they alledge, haue so little shew, that we thinke our aduersaries are beholding vnto vs for letting of them passe, without arguing thereon. If in the Scripture there be any speech of a boyling pot, of the filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the danghters of Sion, of a ditch wherein there is no water; or if it be said that God rebuketh in his wrath, they are (as they say) as many proofes of Purgatory.

And in the margent these words are set, <hi>Vbi nunc purgatorium?</hi> And in the second Sermon of the Consolation of the dead, which is in the ninth tome of Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> works, cap. 1, he saith:<note n="r" place="margin">Recedens ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma ab Angelis suscipitur, &amp; collocatur aut in sinu Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hae si fidelis est, aut in carceris inferni custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia si peccatrix est.</note> The soule going out of the body is receiued by the Angels, and placed in <hi>Abrahams</hi> bosome if it be faithfull, or in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernall prison of hell if it be sinfull.</p>

                  <p>In the booke of the Desert of sinnes, and of pardon thereof, cap. 28. He saith,<note n="u" place="margin">Nec est vllus vlli medius lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus vt possit esse nisi cum diabolo qui non est cum Christo.</note>
                     <hi>There is no middle way, in such manner that he which dwelleth not with Iesus Christ, must dwel elsewhere with the diuell.</hi> And it is to be noted, that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in this place maintaineth, that little children which are not baptized, are in hell. Certainly he would not haue bene so hard and rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous against those children, if he had knowne of any other place of punishment, which is not so rigorous, or shorter, as <hi>Limbus patrum,</hi> or Purgatorie.</p>
                  <p>These places in this Father ought to be taken for a reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a doubt which he sometimes had, whether after this life, there is any temporall torment and purging fire. And in his Manuell to <hi>Larentius,</hi> cap. 68. he saith, That that fire which proueth euery mans worke, whereof Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Cor 3.11, speaketh, is the triall of afflictions which is made in this life. And proceeding in that matter in the chapter fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing he saith,<note n="x" place="margin">Tale aliquid etiam post hanc vitam fieri incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile non est, &amp; vtrum ita sit quaeri potest, &amp; aut inueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri aut latere non nullos fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les per ignem quendam pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatorium.

                     <hi>It is not a thing incredible, that such a thing may happen after this life, and we may doubt whether it be such as may be found or whether it be an hidden thing, that certaine faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full persons shall be saued by purging fire, some sooner some later, as they loued and affected the things of this world.</hi> He doubteth whether he should beleeue this purgation by fire, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ancient Fathers referred to the day of iudgement.</p>
                  <p>And in the booke of the eight questions propounded by <hi>Dulitius,</hi> in the first question, he saith, Whether men suffer afflictions onely in this life, or whether after this life some such punishments ensue, it is not a thing (as I thinke) farre from the apparence of truth.</p>
                  <p>In the 26 chapter of the 21 booke of the Citie of God, he saith of transitory tribulation after this life, <hi>Non redarguo quia forsitan verum est,</hi> I denie it not, because it may be it is true. We haue also seene before, two formal places out of the book of the Citie of God, wherein he putteth this purgation to be at the day of iudgement: but in the 21 booke and 16 chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he is of a contrary minde, and saith,<note n="y" place="margin">Purgatorias autem poenas nullas futuras opinetur, nisi ante illud vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timū tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dumque iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium.</note> That we must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that there are no purging paines, but those that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the latter iudgement. Which makes me beleeue that
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:11462:137"/> this place hath bene corrupted or thrust into his booke by malice; and that it is not credible, that this Doctor who in so many other places affirmeth the contrary, should be so for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getfull, and that in one selfe same booke he should contradict himselfe; or that by purging paines he vnderstandeth the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of this life.</p>
                  <p>We will end this question with an expresse sentence out of Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the first in his 13. booke vpon <hi>Iob,</hi> cap. 20, where he saith,<note n="z" place="margin">Quia autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris nostri gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia redempti sumus hoc iam coelestis mune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris habemus, vt cùm de car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis nostrae ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitatione sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trahimur, mox ad coelestia praemia duca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur.</note> Because we are redeemed by the grace of our creator, we haue this heauenly gift, that when our soules depart out of this fleshly habitation, we are presently carried to the reward of eternall rest.

This businesse is altogether superfluous.</p>
                  <p>For he shall not need to trouble himselfe to take that out of prison which is not there. And though it were so, yet the afflictions and troubles of the Saints whom God hath suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently rewarded in their owne persons, would not be an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable satisfaction.

                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:11462:137"/>
                  <p>As also that the satisfaction of Iesus Christ is sufficient, without borrowing the afflictions of the Saints, or the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stings, pilgrimages, and whippings of Monkes, 1. Iohn 1.7. <hi>The bloud of our Lord Iesus Christ cleanseth vs from all sinne:</hi> and Acts 4.12. <hi>There is no saluation in any other.</hi> He giueth no ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to the Saints to pay a debt which is discharged, nor to make Satisfaction for that for the which he himselfe hath fully satisfied. It is a mocking of the Saints, to set them on worke to do a thing which is done before.</p>
                  <p>If the Pope were bound to yeeld an account of his actions, and to shew by what authority he doth that which he doth, could he shew in what place God hath giuen him that power to take soules out of Purgatory? Secondly, who hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him to heape vp the superabundant satisfactions of Saints and Monkes in his treasurie? Thirdly, where and when did God first command him to distribute them to others? I beleeue he would be hardly bestead: for that the high Priests in the old Testament did not gather together the superabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant satisfactions of <hi>Noe</hi> nor of <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor made any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribution of them: nor neuer thought of taking any soules out of Purgatory, either by power of iurisdicton, or any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of suffrages. Seeing also, that neither Iesus Christ, nor the Apostles, nor yet the ancient Church for many yeares neuer spake of this treasure, nor did not by Pardons distribute the ouerplus of humane satisfactions, nor established priuiledged altars, nor tooke any soules out of Purgatory. And <hi>Gabriel Biel</hi> in his 57. Lecture vpon the Canon of the Masse, and Cardinall <hi>Caietan</hi> in the beginning of the booke of Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, acknowledge, That in all antiquity there is nothing found touching Pardons.</p>
                  <p>The abuse thereof is most euident and cleare, in this, that the remission of sinnes is tyed to a certaine Church, in such manner that he which should elsewhere do three times as many deuotions should not haue the same pardon. And in this, that when the day of Iubilie is at Rome, those that are neare thereunto haue their remission at their ease; but those which are three hundred leagues from thence, and want mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:11462:138"/> or a good horse, or a good paire of legs, are depriued of that spirituall liberality. And herein, that the Pope giueth full pardon of all sinnes, and a third part of sinnes besides, that is to say, that he forgiues all their sinnes, and many others. As also herein, that the Pope and the Clergie draw great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and vse a great trafficke thereby. The Iubilie is the great haruest of the Citie of Rome: then offerings and treasure come thither from all places. And in this, that the Pope giueth pardons without any exact calculation, (as hauing secretly reckoned with God) giuing eighteene thousand yeares of pardon, and as many times forty dayes, and some dayes more: there wanted nothing but houres and minutes. And in this, that he throwes pardons abroad like a handfull of crownes among the prease, as when he throwes a thousand yeares of pardon among the prease of the people vpon the day of his Coronation.</p>
                  <p>But specially and aboue all, it is an admirable thing, that Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ mediateth and intreateth for the soules that are in Purgatory, and that they come not forth from thence by his intercession, but come out by the Popes pardons. Which can neither be blanched nor excused, by that which some say, that the intercession of Iesus Christ doth not exempt the faithfull from sicknesse and other afflictions in this present life. For the intercession of Iesus Christ serueth not to hurt vs: but it should be hurtfull vnto vs, if it depriued vs of the wholesome remedies which God vseth to amend vs, which are sicknesse and afflictions. In which rancke Purgatory is not to be reckoned, which serueth not to amend and instruct sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and to keepe them in the feare of God. We cannot say, that it should be an hurtfull thing to those soules not to be burnt, and to be presently carried into Paradise. Christs satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction exempteth vs from satisfying, but depriueth vs not of corrections and wholesome trials. And the Pope doth not by his pardons exempt men from sicknesse, but will haue them to beleeue that he drawes soules out of Purgatory. Wherein he manifestly exalts himselfe aboue God: for if it be Gods will to punish his children in a fire, why will not the Popes
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:11462:138"/> suffer him to punish them as it pleaseth him? Aske him by what authoritie he doth that, and he will say, That God gaue <hi>Peter</hi> the power to vnbinde and loose vpon earth. Put the case that this were likewise said of the Pope, yet that place speaketh not of loosing vnder the earth; the power of the Keyes extendeth not to the dead.</p>

By the like policie where any profit may be procured to the Popes and Prelates, they haue aduanced the dignitie of marriage, placing it among the number of the Sacraments of the Church, thereby to draw the knowledge of matrimoniall causes to themselues, vnder pretence that it belongs to the Church to take knowledge of the Sacraments. And yet forgetting themselues, they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie some by deputies, which they would finde to be absurd in the other Sacraments, and would not suffer any one to be baptized for another. By the same policy they haue forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den marriage in the third and fourth degree, and forged for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden degrees of spirituall parentage; because, the more prohibitions that are made, men come the oftener vnto them for Dispensations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Touching this question, if we take the word of God for Iudge heerein, the difference will soone be ended. For the chiefe Doctors of the Church of Rome confesse, that we haue no commandement from God touching the same.<note place="margin">

And <hi>to auoide fornication.</hi> Then this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is made to spirituall persons subiect to fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 In the same chapter verse ninth, it is said; <hi>But if they can not abstaine, let them marrie, for it is better to marie then to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:11462:140"/> burne.</hi> Then an vnchast priest that hath not the gift of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie is bound to marrie. It serues not his turne to say, that he hath made a vow not to marrie, and that he must obserue and keepe his vow. For the same priest hath also made a vow not to commit adultery: and although he had not made that vow, yet he is bound thereunto, seeing that God in his Law forbiddeth adulterie. Now which promise is most strictly to be obserued, either that which a man maketh to God, to obserue and obey his commandements, or that which he maketh to the Church, without the commandement of God? Which bond or obligation is the strongest, either that which a man oweth to God whether he will or not, or that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we willingly binde our selues, without any necessitie, and without the word of God? Then how comes it to passe, that the marriage of a priest, contrary to an vnnecessarie vow, is called sacriledge; but if he committeth adulterie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the commandement of God, the fault is esteemed a thousand times lesse? I say, that adultery committed by a priest, not onely breaketh his vow made to God to obey his Law, but also infringeth the vow of chastitie that he made when he was made a priest, so that he breaketh two vowes. But if he marrie, he breakes but one, and that was made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the word of God. So adultery committed by a priest is a double sacriledge, because therby two vowes are broken.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 If all men be bound, and that without a vow, to obey God, then priests are bound to obey the commandement of God pronounced by the Apostle, <hi>If they cannot abstaine, let them marrie.</hi> Holy, iust, and necessarie obligations to salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cannot be broken by vnnecessarie subsequent vowes.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Hereunto I adde, that it is an abuse heere to alledge the vow not to marrie: for that vowes are good, first, if we vow good things: secondly, if we vow willingly and with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what we do: thirdly, if we vow things which are in our power to do. Now in this vow, not to marry, there wanteth three things. First, for that a man that is not continent, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth neuer to marrie: that is to say, that he will vow to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey God, that will haue persons that haue not the gift of
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:11462:140"/> continencie, to marrie, feeling himselfe not able to containe, he will vow to abstaine from the remedie of incontinencie which God hath ordained. This vow being cōtrary to Gods will, is of no force, and yet he is constrained to keepe his vow, although he should commit adultery a thousand times.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Secondly, this vow also is ordinarily made vnwillingly, and without knowing what it is. Men make their daughters Nunnes at twelue yeares, and their sonnes Monkes at four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene yeares of age: then when they do not know what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiscence meaneth: which after beginning to kindle in them, worketh with double force, like cinders that are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered ouer with ashes, and at the last breake out violently into a flame. A father to discharge himselfe of his dutie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his children, putteth the weakest and imperfectest of them into an house of religion, and offereth the maimed and lame vnto God. And those poore children entring ioyfully into the Fishers weele, soone after, at their leisure, sigh and grone in their captiuitie.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Lastly, by this vow men promise things which are not in their power: for chastitie is a gift which God bestoweth not vpon many men. The vnchaste life of the most part of those that make this vow, sufficiently sheweth it. To quench naturall affections, we must haue a supernaturall gift, which is not in our power. The Apostle 1. Cor. 7 7. feeling him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be exempted from those desires, said, <hi>I would that all men were euen as I my selfe am:</hi> But to shew that few haue that gift, he addeth. <hi>But euery man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, another after that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8 Whereupon <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>2</hi> de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac. cap. <hi>31.</hi>
                     </note> that this gift is not in our power; yet, that euery man may aske the same of God. But he considereth not that God will not heare our prayers, if they be not made in faith; as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> saith 1.6.7. and also that this faith is a gift of God. Ephesians 2. which gift God giueth not to all men, 2. Thes. 3.2. As also that he which asketh grace of God not to marrie, hath no promise that God will heare him. It is true that God promiseth to giue vs all things that we shall aske in the name of Iesus Christ: but
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:11462:141"/> he speaketh of things necessarie to saluation, of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, perpetuall virginitie is none. And God gaue not that gift to those men whom he loued most, as to <hi>Moses,</hi> to <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> to <hi>Dauid,</hi> and to <hi>Esay, &amp;c.</hi> But, how should Priests and Clerks of the church of Rome be assured to obtaine the gift of chastitie, which is not necessarie to saluation, and which God hath not promised, seeing that they make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, not to be assured by prayer to obtaine the saluation which God promiseth? Then vowing chastitie, they vow that which God hath not promised them, and which they are not assured to obtaine, and which is not in their power. Whence it followeth, that this vow is rashly made, and by consequence, is not to be obserued.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 Also, we haue examples of the Prophets extraordinarily and miraculously inspired, and indued with the Spirit of God; as <hi>Moses, Samuel, Esay, &amp;c.</hi> which were married and had chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The priests also in the old Law were married, and that in such a time, when as in externall things, and in cleanenesse and ceremoniall exactnesse, God required a greater puritie then he doth vnder the Gospell. And if marriage had bene vnfit for the priests in the old Law, God would haue ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned some other meanes to continue the order of priests, then by succession from the father to the sonne. To this they make no answer: for that which they say, is no answer: They say that the priests abstained from their wiues in the time of their seruice. A thing inuented by themselues, and which cannot be proued. But to the contrary it is found that <hi>Aaron</hi> and his sonnes were daily both morning and euening to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vpon the sacrifice, and to burne incense euery morning, Exodus 30.7. as also, that the ordinarie food of the high Priest and of his familie, was that portion of the sacrifices which was allotted vnto them.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 Neuerthelesse, put case that it were so; can abstinence for a few dayes serue, or be sufficient to establish perpetuall virginitie? For such an abstinence did not depriue the priests of the end and intent of marriage, which is to beget chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to preuent incontinencie: but perpetuall single life
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:11462:141"/> depriueth a man of those things, intangleth him in wicked desires, and resisteth nature. Which serueth for an answer to the like allegations. As the prohibition made to the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, not to touch their wiues carnally for the space of three dayes before the publication of the Law. And that which the Apostle 1. Corint. 7.5. saith, <hi>Defraud not one another, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be with consent fot a time, that you may giue your selues to fasting and prayer, and againe come together, that Sathan tempt you not for your incontinencie.</hi>

Which I alleadge, not that I beleeue that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> was married, but to shew that <hi>Clement</hi> did not esteeme marriage to be incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible with the Apostles office. In the 21. chapter of the Acts, verse 9. it is said that <hi>Philip</hi> rhe Euangelist had foure daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. <hi>Platina</hi> in the life of <hi>Cletus</hi> the first saith, that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> was married, and that his wife was in Bithynia.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 Our Aduersaries answer, and say, that it is true, that those holy seruants of God had wiues, but that they lay not with them, and had not the carnall vse of their bodies.

Who doubts that the high Priests and the Pharisies that sifted him so narrowly, would not haue persecuted him therefore, as hauing imposed a yoke vpon them which God had not set downe in his Law? <hi>Defraud not one another,</hi> saith
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:11462:142"/> the Apostle, <hi>but come together againe,</hi> 1. Cor. 7.5. If to defraud one another be a vice in other men, why had it bene a vertue in the Apostles?</p>
                  <p n="13">13 It is true, that the Apostles said to Iesus Christ, Matth. 19.27. <hi>We haue forsaken all, and followed thee:</hi> To whom Iesus Christ made answer and said, verse 29. <hi>Whosoeuer shall forsake houses, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or lands, for my names sake, he shall receiue an hundred fold more, and shall inherit eternall life.</hi> But it is a great abuse, to take that which he saith to all the faithfull, as if it were onely said to the Apostles and Pastors of the Church. For he saith, <hi>Whosoeuer shall forsake, &amp;c.</hi> All the faithfull ought to forsake houses, fields, wiues, children, fathers, mothers, yea and their owne liues, when they cannot keepe them but by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>nying Iesus Christ, or forsaking that vocation whereunto God hath called them. In that case God will haue all humane bands broken, and that all naturall affections shall in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be choked by the zeale and the desire to saue our soules and to follow our vocations. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his 89 Epistle expoundeth that place in this manner, saying: Sometime there happeneth such a necessitie, that we must either leaue our wiues, or Iesus Christ. The place is long, and very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse to this purpose, and he speaketh of all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 It is to be noted also, that Iesus Christ there speakes of forsaking wiues, children, houses, and goods generally, Then seeing the Church of Rome doth iudge, that by this place Priests &amp; Bishops are not bound to forsake and leaue the vse of their goods, why should they by the same place be bound to leaue the vse of their wiues? If a father that is become a Priest, is not bound by this place to be no more a father, why should he by this place be bound to be no more an husband? If he may keepe his goods, why should he not also keepe his wife? for these two things are also ioyntly set downe in this place. And we see by the History of the Gospell, that after Iesus Christ had said that to his Apostles, they did not leaue the propriety and vse of their fisher boates, nor Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> of
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:11462:142"/> his house, whereinto he receiued the virgine <hi>Mary</hi> after the death of Christ our Lord.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 To be short, touching this matter we haue the expresse prohibition of our Lord Iesus Christ saying to his Apostles, Matth. 19.9. <hi>No man shall put away his wife, except it be for whoredome &amp;c:</hi> and verse 6. <hi>The man and his wife are no more twaine, but one flesh. Let no man therefore put asunder that which God hath coupled together.</hi> Seeing that the Lord spake to his disciples in that place, with what shew can they except them onely from the obedience of that commandement? And if they must haue abstained from their wiues, would they haue kept them with them? this could not h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="16">16 The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the first to Tim. 4.1.2.3. saith, <hi>In the latter times some shall depart from the faith, and shall giue heed vnto spirits of error, and doctrine of diuels: which speake lies through hypocrisie, &amp; haue their consciences burnt with an hot iron, forbidding to marrie, &amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>To shun this place, they say, that the Apostle speaketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst other heretickes, which condemned mariage as a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and filthy thing in it selfe.</p>
                  <p>Wherunto I answer, that there is no prohibition in the word of God which a man may not shift off by the same meanes. So theeues may dispense with the Law, which saith, <hi>Thou shalt not steale,</hi> by saying, that that is spoken against those that steale without necessitie, or that steale from their friends, but not to those that steale for need, or that rob a stranger. So adultery may be permitted, by saying that God forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth women to haue to do with many men, but not to haue a friend in a corner. The Apostles words are generall; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception condemne those Doctors which forbid mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. When the King by his proclamation maketh a generall prohibition, doth it belong to the subiect to make excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and restraints vpon the same, which are not contained in the Proclamation? and without hauing any warrant or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration

Whosoeuer brings any exceptions or restraints against a generall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, made vnto vs in his word, ought to draw and take his exceptions out of the word of God. If it be euill to condemne mariage as a filthy vncleane thing, it is not much lesse to condemne it by tyrannie and by superstition. We may run into one selfe same danger by diuerse meanes: one selfe same error may enter and be grounded in mens minds by diuerse and seuerall reasons. And I see not how those which condemne mariage as being a filthy vncleane thing, can speake of mariage in more odious termes, then the Popes <hi>Syricius</hi> and <hi>Innocent</hi> aforesaid do, which call it a vice, and an impurity and vncleannesse, and esteeme it to be contrary to holinesse.</p>

Tim. 3.2. saith, <hi>A Bishop must be vnreproueable, the husband of one wife, one that can rule his owne house honestly, hauing children vnder obedience with all honestie: for if any cannot rule his owne house, how shall he take care of the Church of God?</hi> And in the 12. verse, <hi>Let the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons be the husbands of one wife:</hi> and verse 11. <hi>Likewise their wiues must be honest not euill speakers, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To contend and striue about that, is not to dispute against vs, but to giue the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the lie, vnder a colour of interpreting his words. For you must note, that he saith not, that the Bishop <hi>hath bene,</hi> but that he <hi>must be</hi> the husband of one wife. For if the Apostle had vnderstood that a Bishop had bene the husband of one wife, we must by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son say, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> will haue a Bishop to haue bene, but not that he should be, without reproofe. By this meanes the bishopricke shall be an entry into vice, and an exemption from doing good.</p>
                  <p>Againe the Apostle ordaineth, that their wiues shall be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, sober, and faithfull: he speaketh then of Bishops and Deacons which haue wiues, and not of those that haue none as being dead. For the Apostle instructeth not dead women, but instructeth Bishops wiues, lest that by their vices they should dishonour their busbands vocation. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the first,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:11462:143"/> in his 85. Epistle vnderstood it so: saying. The Apostle saith,<note place="margin">Dicente Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolo vt Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus ordine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur quē vnius vxoris virum fuisse aut esse constiterit.</note> that we must chuse a Bishop that hath bene, or that is, the husband of one wife.</p>
                  <p>Not that the Apostle esteemeth or placeth mariage to be one of the vertues in a Bishop, or that he forbiddeth a man vnlesse he be maried to be made a Bishop. The Apostle onely forbiddeth a Bishop to haue two wiues, for that as then po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygamie, or the hauing of many wiues together, was vsed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Iewes, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> in the 17 booke of his Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, cap. 1. witnesseth saying:<note place="margin">

                        </gap>.</note> It is the manner of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie to haue many wiues together; and then <hi>Herod</hi> had nine wiues. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> to <hi>Oceanus</hi> saith the same. <hi>Theodoret</hi> vpon this place saith the same both of the Greekes and the Iewes. Looke also in <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his 10. Homilie vpon the 1. to Timothie.</p>
                  <p>A man may haue two wiues two wayes, either by keeping two wiues in his house together, or else putting away his lawfull wife without any cause of adulterie, and marrying with another. For Iesus Christ in <hi>Mathew</hi> 19.9. declareth, that marriage cannot lawfully be dissolued, vnlesse it be for adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. In this latter manner a woman may haue two husbands, if she haue left her first husband, or if she hath bene put away without committing adulterie, and is married to another husband. A thing which was common, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his 89 Epistle, Question 4 declareth. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> in his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistle to <hi>Oceanus</hi> saith, That <hi>Fabiola</hi> forsooke her husband.

                  <p>Such were the women which the Apostle 1. Tim. 5.9. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth from hauing any charge of ministring in the Church,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:11462:144"/> saying, <hi>Let not a widow be taken into the number vnder</hi> 60. <hi>yeares old, and that hath bene the wife of one husband.</hi> That is to say, that hath not had two husbands together, the one dwelling with her, the other separated by diuorce, whether she sought a diuorce with the first, or whether her husband put her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for adulterie. For you must not beleeue that the Apostle excludeth a widow from ministring in the Church, that hath maried againe to another husband after the death of her first husband, seeing that in the same Chapter he commandeth yong widowes to marrie againe. For else he should command them to do a thing which would make them vnworthy to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister in the Church. Whereupon I cannot but be much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bashed at a Romish Decree, wherein they permit a Canon to be extant, which saith, that the Apostle spake both against reason and truth, and that by commanding to marrie againe, he permitteth fornication. It is the 31 Cause in the first Distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, <hi>Hac ratione.</hi> The words are these:<note n="*" place="margin">Hac ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Apostoli praeceperunt secundas adire nuptias, prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter incontinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam hominū.

Sed cum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittente Deo publicè &amp; li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittitur, fit honestè forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catio.</note> By this meanes also the Apostle commanded to marrie againe, because of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continency of men. For according to the Apostles comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, it is permitted to take a second wife, but according to the reason of truth, it is meere adulterie. But seeing God permitting it, it is done puclickly and by licence, he committeth an honest adulterie. Some<note n="**" place="margin">The Iesuite Baile Quest. 23. of his Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techisme.</note> being not able to auoyd the force of this so cleare and expresse a place of the Apostle, confesse that then Bishops were married: but that they were constrained to chuse such Bishops because as then they could not find a sufficient number of men that were not married to gouerne the Church.</p>
                  <p>To say so, is to weaken the power of Iesus Christ. For it is certaine, that it was not by constraint, nor for want of other meanes, that he chose his Apostles which were married men, namely Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> seeing he had the hearts of all men in his power, and could inuest the most incapable persons with suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient graces to that end. And if at this day those onely which are endued with the gift of continencie were admitted into the priesthood, would there thinke you, be a sufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber found to fill the places that are voyd?</p>
                  <pb n="251" facs="tcp:11462:144"/>
                  <p n="18">18 The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 9.5. saith thus, <hi>Haue we not power to leade about a wife being a sister, as well as the rest of the Apostles, and as the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</hi>

But to go out of their countrie, to passe ouer the seas, to go a thousand or twelue hundred leagues with the Apostles, was a thing which an honest wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man neither could nor ought to do: and which naturall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection towards h r familie would not haue permitted.

                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:11462:145"/>
                  <p>The Apostles words take away all difficultie: for such wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would haue followed the Apostles by charitie, and not by any power which the Apostles had ouer them: for the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle saith: <hi>Haue I not power to leade about a wife being a sister?</hi> He would rather haue said in the plurall number: <hi>Haue I not power to leade about women being sisters?</hi> For such duties of charitie and domesticall seruices, are more easily and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly performed by diuers women.</p>

                     <p>They thinke to auoide this, by saying that the Apostle speaketh not of those who abstaine from certaine meates with humilitie and to tame their flesh: but of those that estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med meats to be polluted &amp; abominable. That was long ago the pretence of those to whom the Apostle spake, and which in his time erred in that point, saying, <hi>Eate not, touch not, taste not,</hi> as the Apostle, Coloss. 2.20. saith, <hi>Why, as though you li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the world, are ye burthened with traditions? as, touch not, taste not, handle not. which all perish with the vsing, and are after the commandements and doctrines of men?</hi> Then he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that which made the prohibition of meates, to those that forbad it to seeme plausible, saying, <hi>Which things haue indeed a shew of wisedome in voluntarie religion and humblenesse of minde, and in not sparing the body, not in any honour to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfying of the flesh.</hi> This is iustly the words and allegations of our Aduersaries, and the ends for the which they ordaine and establish the distinction of meates, which neuerthelesse the Apostle reiecteth, calling them Commandements and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of men. It makes no difference whether he speaketh to the Iewes or to the Gentiles, seeing that generally he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth those that abstaine from meates with humilitie and by exercise.</p>

                     <p n="2">2 The said Apostle in the same chapter, 16. verse, saith, <hi>Let no man therefore condemne you in meate and drinke, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new Moone, or of the Sabbath dayes.</hi> Then why doth the Church of Rome condemne vs for not obseruing their prohibitions of meates, and for not keeping those holy dayes which they ordaine?</p>
                     <p n="3">3 The said Apostle in 1. Cor. 10.25. saith, <hi>Whatsoeuer is
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:11462:147"/> sold in the shambles, eate ye, and aske no question for conscience sake; for the earth is the Lords, and all that therein is. If any of them which beleeue not, call you to a feast, and if you will go, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is set before you, eate, asking no question for conscience sake.</hi> What can be more expressely said? The Church of Rome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemeth vs to be heretikes and placeth vs among the ranke of infidels. Now if we should bid one of the Church of Rome to a dinner or supper, would he eate of all things that should be set before him vpon a fish or fasting day? would he without scrupulositie eate of euery thing there?</p>
                     <p n="4">4 But is it credible that Iesus Christ hath by the Gospell abolished the distinctions of meates in the Law of <hi>Moses,</hi> to establish other distinctions, and to make prohibitions that are a thousand times more troublesome? and for one fasting day that was vnder the Law, to establish fiftie vnder the Gospell?</p>
                     <p n="5">5 The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Cor. 8.8. saith, <hi>Meate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vs not acceptable to God, for neither if we eate haue we the more, neither if we eate not, haue we the lesse.</hi> And Rom. 14.17. <hi>The kingdome of God is not meate nor drinke, but righteousnesse, and peace, and ioy in the holy Ghost.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And generally of all such obseruations, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 1. Tim. 4.8. saith, <hi>For bodily exercise profiteth little, but godlinesse is profitable vnto all things, which hath the promise of the life pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and of that that is to come.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>All this which we said before, is not spoken to condemne fasting, nor the obseruation of Ecclesiasticall fasts, ordinarie or extraordinarie; onely we seeke to take away and abolish the opinion of merites and satisfactions thereby. And make fasting to consist in abstinence and sobrietie, and not in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of meates, commanded by a man to whom God hath not giuen that power, and that vnder pretence of absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence establisheth his Empire, and layeth a yoke vpon mens consciences contrary to the word of God. We also condēne not that man, who to ease and tame the motions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocatiots of his desires or concupiscences, abstaineth from wine or from certaine meates; so his fasting be voluntarie,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:11462:147"/> and not scrupulous, nor with opinion of merit or satisfaction, nor by command vsurped ouer him by any man. Such was <hi>Daniels</hi> fast, abstaining from wine, flesh, and pleasant bread, <hi>Daniel</hi> 10.3. for there was no law in Israel touching such ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence.</p>
                     <p>Therefore it is in vaine here to make discourses in the praise of fasting and of sobrietie, which we know to be the nurses of vertues, guardians of chastitie, and prouocations to watchfulnesse. In the composing of mans bodie, God placed the braines farre from the belly, to the end that the kitchin of the bodie should be far from the Study, and that the sauor of meates should not interrupt meditation. For nothing more troubleth holy cogitations then the tumult of concupiscen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, stirred vp and kindled by drunkennes or gluttonie. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is harder to be brought to the feare of God, then a man who better relisheth sweete sauces then wholesome instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and hath a better palate then braine. Therefore the Scripture oftentimes ioyneth fasting with praier, that prayer might sanctifie fasting: and that fasting might kindle prayer. So <hi>Anna,</hi> Luke 2.37. and <hi>Cornelius</hi> Acts 10.4. serued God in fastings and prayers. And Iesus Christ telleth vs of a certaine kinde of spirits, which are not driuen out but by fasting and prayer, <hi>Matt.</hi> 17.21.</p>
                     <p>The ancient Christians were much giuen to this exercise, abstaining from lawfull things, that they might the easier avoyd vnlawfull things. They sought to make diuers ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie things to become superfluous vnto them, whereas to those that are voluptuous, superfluous things become ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie.</p>
                     <p>But the Church of Rome hath changed this exercise into a scrupulositie, and this abstinence into a distinction of meats, which are more carefully obserued then the Law of God. For adultery, fornication, murder, and periurie, ordinarie priests giue absolutions: but he that confesseth that he hath eaten flesh in an Ember weeke, is sent to a Penitentiarie, because the absolution of so great a sinne is not in the power of ordinarie priests.</p>
                     <pb n="258" facs="tcp:11462:148"/>
                     <p>He that hath neuer so little tasted of flesh in Lent, hath broken the fast, but not he that hath filled his gorge with fish and banquetting stuffe, &amp;c. And the number of these obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue fasts are so great, that they almost take vp sixe moneths in the yeare. Fasting that should be an exercise of humilitie, is become an occasion of pride, and an opinion of merit and of satisfaction: not onely for him that fasteth, but also for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his second booke of Good workes, chap. 11. goeth about to proue that fasting is satisfaction for sinnes, and meritorious for life eternall. And Cardinall <hi>Tolet,</hi> in his sixt booke of the Instruction of Priests, saith, that fasting is <hi>satisfactio pro poenis peccatorum,</hi> that is, a satisfaction for paines due for sinnes: which satisfaction he saith to be meritorious for grace, and an augmentation of glory. Fasting should serue for a confession of sinnes, but at this day it serueth to establish merits, according to the example of the Pharisie, which boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted of his fasting before God, and therefore was reiected, Luke 18.12. How pleasing a prayer do you thinke it would be vnto God, if a man should say, Lord I haue deserued life eternall, for I haue not dined? Or why shouldest thou punish me for my sinnes, seeing I haue satisfied for them, by abstai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from eating of egges and cheese? Yet this is but a small matter, for it is said that some fast oftener then they should do to satisfie for their sinnes, and so there is a superabundance in their satisfaction. Then God owes them something which he is to returne back againe, that that surplussage might serue for others. And eating nothing but fish, a man may satisfie for others. Thereupon <hi>Tolet</hi> saith,<note n="*" place="margin">De instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotali, lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>8.</hi> Si ieiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no pro qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuor, nō minus prodest ad sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactionem singulis quàm vm prodesset si pro vno tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tū ieiuuassem.</note> If I fast for foure persons, I sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie as much for euery one of them, as if I fasted but for one. See the Canon <hi>Animae,</hi> in the 13. Cause, second Question. And to fill vp the measure of this abuse, fastings are redeemed by mony, as it is said in the Distinction 82. in the Canon <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteri.</hi> And in the Glosse vpon the same Canon, he may giue a penny to redeeme or buy out the fast. For certainly he must of force be light of beleefe, that beleeueth that God deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a man out of Purgatory, because his neighbour did not dine. If the fastings of liuing men refresh the dead, then feasts
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:11462:148"/> made by those that are aliue must also burne the dead.</p>
                     <p>I confesse that God oftentimes granteth his aide and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance to those that fast: but it is a great abuse, to attribute that to the merit of fasting which is granted to faith and to prayer which sanctifieth the fast, without which fasting is either a diet for sicke persons, or a want to those that are hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, or an hypocriticall abstinence. Fasting serueth to obtaine, and not to satisfie.</p>
                     <p>To couer this abuse <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> onely addeth a place out of the 15. of the Acts, where the Apostles assembled together in Councell in Ierusalem, commanded the Gentiles that were conuerted to the faith, to abstaine from bloud and from things that are strangled. But the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> which was at that Councell, and knew the Apostles meaning, taketh away that defence, 1. Cor. 10.27. where he saith, <hi>If any of them which beleeue not, call you to a feast, and if you will go, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is set before you, eate, asking no question for conscience sake.</hi> Now it might be that in infidels houses they se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ued strangled fowles vpon the table, or something wherein there was bloud. Shewing thereby that such prohibitions were made, to the end that the Gentiles should not giue offence to the Iewes then newly conuerted to the profession of Christ, and by little and little to bring them thereunto, and to burie the legall ceremonies with honour. Now the Apostle hauing planted the Gospell in Corinth, Acts 18. and after going to Philippi, from thence wrote to the Corinthians: whereby it appeareth, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote that Epistle long time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that Councell was holden in Ierusalem, spoken of in Acts 15.</p>
                     <p>Diuerse ancient Churches hauing not well considered thereon, most exactly obserued abstinence from bloud and things that were strangled, as<note n="*" place="margin">Ne anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium quidem sanguinem in epulus esculen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis habemus.</note>
                        <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the ninth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Apologie witnesseth. The Councel of Gangres in the second Canon speaketh of bloud, and things that are strangled, as of things esteemed to be vnlawfull. The same prohibition is found in the 67. Canon, of the sixteenth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell assembled in the pallace of Constantinople. The like also
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:11462:149"/> is found in the Councels of Wormes and of Orleans But Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> better instructed in the holy Scriptures, explaineth this point in the 32 booke against <hi>Faustus,</hi> cap. 13. saying: The<note n="*" place="margin">Flegisse mihi videntur Apostoli pro tempore rem facilem, in qua cum Israelitis gentes aliquid communiter obseruarent. Quis iam hoc Christianus obseruat vt turdos vel mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutiores aui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culas non at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingat, nisi quarum san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis effusus est?

And after addeth, What Christian is there, who at this time will obserue the not touching of Thrushes, or other little birds, whose bloud hath not bene shed? and a few persons that make scruple of these things are mocked by others, The Church of Rome is of the same iudgement, knowing well that the Apostles established those prohibitions for a time, and not for a perpetuall rule. But she is much to be condemned herein, for hauing in stead of those two prohibitions, established many other more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous. Certainly, if the Christian Church had need of any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruations touching the distinction of meates, it were much better to haue reuiued the abstinences obserued in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles time, rather then to forge a multitude of others, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand times more painfull, and contrary to the practise of the Apostles and of Iesus Christ himselfe, who in the weeke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Easter vsually did eate the Paschall Lambe.</p>

                     <p>Our aduersary fats himselfe with the question of the visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the markes of the Church, with most pleasing elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and that which serueth onely for quicke spirits. To looke better into this matter, it is necessary for vs to vnfold the ambiguitie of the word Church.</p>
                     <p>The word Church, is a Greeke word, which signifieth an
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:11462:150"/> assembly, and which belongeth as well to the assemblies of infidels as of the faithfull. In the 26. Psalme, verse 5. according to the vulgar translation it is said,<note place="margin">Odiui Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siam malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nantium.</note> I haue hated the Church of euill doers. And Acts 19.32. the assembly of the Pagans crying, <hi>Great is Diana of the Ephesians,</hi> is called the Church. Vse hath brought in a custome, that the assemblies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians are called Churches, and thereby were distinguished from the Synagogues of the Iews, although these two words haue all one signification.</p>
                     <p>Then to restraine our selues to the sence wherein this word Church is taken among Christians, I say, that this word Church in the Scriptures is taken diuers wayes. Sometimes the Church is taken for the whole body and assembly of the elect, and those that are predestinated to saluation, whereof some are already triumphant in heauen, others militant here on earth; the rest not yet borne, but in the counsell of God are enrolled and registred to fight in Gods warre in future time, and ordained to obtaine the victory. Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his 1. Epistle 2.9. calleth it <hi>a chosen generation.</hi> And because the Scripture saith, that the elect are written in the booke of life, and that their names are written in heauen, the Apostle, Hebr. 12.32, calleth it, <hi>The assemblie and congregation of the first borne, which are written in heauen.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iam in corpore Christs nō sunt quod est Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia, quoniam non potest ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bere Christus membra dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nata.</note> This Church by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle is often called the body of Christ, and by consequence, false, hypocriticall, and prophane Christians are no part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: for the body of Iesus Christ hath no dead members, nor men cast off by God, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his 21 chap. 2 booke against <hi>Cresconius</hi> teacheth.

For he that is a member of the body of Christ, cannot be a member of the diuell. This Church is the spouse of Iesus Christ, to the which he hath ioyned himselfe, that he might make it a glorious Church, without spot or wrinkle, to the end, that it should be holy and vnreprou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="264" facs="tcp:11462:151"/> 5.27. Those that are of this Church, as long as they are here on earth, are visible as they are men, but not as they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, for election is not discerned by the eye, but is chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably presumed vpon by profession of faith, and by good workes. Out of this Church there can be no saluation.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes by the word <hi>Church</hi> the Scripture vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all the assemblie of those that make professiō to be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians. That is the vniuersall visible Church, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of diuers particular Churches; as in the Apostles time, the Churches of Corinth, Rome, Thessalonica, and the seuen Churches spoken of in the 2 and 3 of the Apocalyps. Of these particular Churches some are purer then others, and some so impure that in them a man cannot be saued, specially when idolatrie is maintained, and the doctrine of the benefite of Christ wholly corrupted therein.</p>
                     <p>This vniuersall visible Church is that which the Apostle 1. Tim. 3.14 calleth, <hi>the pillar and ground of truth,</hi> because the dutie thereof is, to vphold and maintaine the diuine truth against all those that seeke to corrupt and suppresse the same. Which also is the dutie of euery particular Church. And there is no particular Church which is sound in faith, but it is a pillar, and ground of the truth.</p>
                     <p>When we say, that out of this vniuersall visible Church there is no saluation, we vnderstand that no man can be saued which separateth himselfe from the communion of the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Church, and liueth apart, without ioyning himselfe to any flocke. Neuerthelesse, if any man should be excluded out of the communion of the Church, by an vniust excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; or if any man seeking to become a Christian, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing in Iesus Christ, is preuented by death before he can be baptized, we do not beleeue that such a man is excluded from saluation. So that as well by our Confession, as also by that of our aduersaries, in this maxime (that out of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church there is no saluation) there are some exceptions to be made.</p>
                     <p>Touching particular Churches, there is not one of them, whereof (to be saued) we must necessarily be a member. If
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:11462:151"/> the Church of Rome were without error, yet a man might neuerthelesse be saued out of her. Those that shall liue in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular Churches where the Gospell is purely prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, shall not be without saluation, although they had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer heard of the Romish Church, because it is but a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Church.</p>
                     <p>Besides these three significations of the word <hi>Church,</hi> the Scripture sometimes vnderstandeth the people to be the Church, without comprehending the Pastors of the Church therein; as when Pastors are commanded to feed the Church, Acts. 20.28.</p>
                     <p>Sometimes also by the word <hi>Church,</hi> the Pastors onely are vnderstood, as in these words, <hi>Tell the Church,</hi> Matth. 18.17. For Iesus Christ will haue the partie offended, to go to the Pastors of the Church, to take vp the matter.</p>
                     <p>The conclusion of all this is, that the word <hi>Church</hi> in the Scripture is taken:</p>
                     <p n="1">1 Sometime for all the assemblie of the elect.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Sometime for the vniuersall visible Church.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Sometime for a particular Church.</p>
                     <p n="4">4 Sometime for the people onely.</p>
                     <p n="5">5 Sometime for the Pastors onely.</p>
                     <p>These diuers significations of the word <hi>Church,</hi> are neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to be remembred, for that in the ambiguitie of the word the error lieth hidden, and slippeth into it like a snake into brambles &amp; briers. And our aduersaries expresly studying to confound this matter, take all those fiue significations for one, &amp; as often as the Scripture speaketh of the Church, they will alwaies haue it to be vnderstood of the Church of Rome. Sometimes also by the Church they vnderstand the Pope on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third did, who attributed the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie betweene <hi>Philip Augustus</hi> king of France, and <hi>Iohn</hi> king of England, to belong vnto himselfe, because in the Gospel it is said, <hi>Dic Ecclesiae.</hi> In the chapter, <hi>Nouit. Extra. de Iudicijs.</hi> And Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the second book of Councels, 19 chap. saith, The Pope should tell it to the Church, that is, to himself.</p>
                     <p>But specially in the question which <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> propoundeth touching the visibilitie of the Church, these distinctions are
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:11462:152"/> necessarie, to the end that when men speake of the visible Church, they should not produce those places of Scripture that speake of the Church of the elect, which is not discerned by the eye. To the end that when we speake of the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and decisions of the Church, we should not speake of the Church of the elect, which is neuer assembled to decide any causes. And to the end that no particular Church should call it selfe vniuersall, as if all the rest were nothing, or were no Churches but by her permission.</p>
                     <p>So when men aske which are the marks of the true Church, our intent is not to speake of the Church of the elect, which hath no markes discernable by the eye. <hi>God knoweth who are his</hi> 2. Tim. 2.19. <hi>He sealeth them hy his Spirit vnto the day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> Ephes. 4.30. and giueth them <hi>the white stone</hi> spoken of in Reuelation, 2.17, which is the testimony of the Spirit of adoption <hi>which witnesseth with our spirits, that we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> Rom. 8.16. But this witnesse is secret, and not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the sight of man.</p>
                     <p>I say more, which is, that when we dispute of the markes of the true Church, we speake not of the vniuersall visible Church, the markes whereof are without question. For the marke which discerneth the vniuersall visible Church from the Iewes, Turkes, and Pagans, is the profession of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitie, and the sacrament of Baptisme. Then the disputation is touching the particular Churches: for that, there being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers particular Churches disagreeing among themselues, we seeke those markes whereby the true Church, that is, the pure, and orthodoxall Church (wherein a man may be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,) is discerned from the impure, wherein there is no salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For by this word, true Church, we must necessarily vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the pure and the sound Church. For otherwise an hereticall Church may be called a true Church, euen as a man that hath a canker, or a plague sore, is yet a true man.</p>

Arnoux,</hi> which accuseth vs that we put the Church out of sight, he saith it without proofe, and our Confession saith nothing thereof. But on the contrarie we know that there hath alwaies bene, and shall be a Church visible in the world. But we must know how, and to whom it is visible. For it is one thing to see the Church, as an assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of men calling themselues Christians; and another thing to see it to be a true and a pure Church, wherein a man may be saued. Those that are out of the Church, as Turkes and Iewes see the Christian Church as we see a company of men, but see not whether it be good, and whether in it a man may be saued, which is the sight and the knowledge which we seeke for, that we may ioyne our selues thereunto. Infidels see the Church, as the incredulous Iewes saw our Sauiour, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing that he was the Sauiour: and as a yong child sees a Mathematician without knowing what the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians are.<note place="margin">Videmus coetū hominum qui est Ecclesia, sed quod ille coetus sit ipsa vera Christi Ecclesia non videmus.</note> As <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his 15 chapter of the third booke of the Church confesseth. Where neuerthelesse he slandereth vs, and imputeth to vs, that we do not acknowledge any visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church.</p>
                  <p>Thereby it appeareth, that no man seeth or knoweth the true Church but those that are members thereof, or that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sufficient instructions haue determined to enter into the same. If the vniuersall Church were reduced but to twelue men onely, yet it should be visible to those twelue. On the contrary, if the Christian Church should containe and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse the halfe of the world, the other halfe continuing in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelitie, should not see that to be the true Church, and would not know it to be an assembly of the faithfull.</p>
                  <p>As touching this superficiall sight whereby those that are out of the Church, see it and know not whether it be a true or a pure Church, if one should aske whether the Church ought in that sort to be visible to all men in the world, &amp; at all times, the question is easie to be answered. For it is certaine,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:11462:153"/> that the Christian Church began first in Iudaea, at which time it was not visible in France, nor in Denmarke. Before the Portugals and Spainards sayled into the Indies, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church was not visible to the west Indians. And there are alwaies more Pagans then Christians in the world, and an infinite number of people that haue not once heard speaking of the Christian Church.</p>
                  <p>And to rise higher, was the Church visible then when <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> was yet in <hi>Vr</hi> in Chaldea, lying in his fathers house, which was an idolater? as it is said in the 24 chapter of <hi>Iosua.</hi> Was the Church visible vnto the Infidels, when the Israelites were in Aeygpt, and there serued the Infidels? as it is said, Ezech. 20.7. and 8. Was the Church visible to the Infidels in the time of king <hi>Achas</hi> and <hi>Manasses,</hi> when those kings made the Temple to be shut vp,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 29.6.7.</note> and when no continuall sacrifice was made, and that Idols were in euery towne, when <hi>Vrias</hi> the high Priest placed a Pagan altar in the Temple? But where shall the Church be visible to those that are out of it, where all the earth shall follow the beast? Apocalyps. 13.3. and when the time shall come whereof our Lord Iesus Christ speaketh, Luke. 18.8, saying, <hi>But when the Sonne of man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, shall he finde faith on the earth?</hi> Shall the Church be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to infidels, in whose time our aduersaries say that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ shall abolish the continuall sacrifice, that is, the Masse, if you will beleeue them?</p>
                  <p>To be short, it is an euident and visible thing, that the Church of God is not alwayes visible to all men: but alwaies visible to those that are members thereof.</p>

<pb n="269" facs="tcp:11462:153"/> comprehend the pure administration of the Sacraments: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the right and true vse of them is prescribed in the word of God. Wherein we speake according to Iesus Christ, who in the 8.31. and 10.27. of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> giueth no other marke to discerne his sheepe, and those that truly are his disciples, but onely to heare his voyce, and to perseuer in his word; <hi>If ye continue in my word, ye are verily my disciples, Iohn</hi> 8.31. <hi>The sheepe heare the voyce of the shepheard, and follow him; for they know his voyce, and wil not follow a stranger.</hi> And say that the word of God did not so expressely speake thereof, yet it is certaine, that we must be voyde of common sense, if we cannot conceiue, that to discerne a pure Church from an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure, there is no other meanes then to see whether it agreeth with the rule of puritie, which is the word of God. As to know whether a Line be straight, we apply it to a straight Rule.</p>
                  <p>But that displeaseth <hi>M. Arnoux,</hi> because (in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) this marke is obscure, and as hard, or hardlier to be knowne then the Church; and that it is the same whereof we dispute, that is, to whom belongeth pure Religion, and who possesseth the word. For he presupposeth, (and with reason) that the markes to know a thing by, ought to be plainer and easier to know, then the thing which we know by those markes.</p>
                  <p>Then the question is, which of these two things is easiest to be knowne, either true faith and Religion, or the true Church</p>
                  <p>Besides the places of Scripture before alledged, which will haue vs to know the true sheepe and disciples of Iesus Christ, that is, if they hearken to his voyce, and keepe his word; reason giueth vs a demonstratiue proofe, grounded vpon this maxime, that definitions and expositions of things ought to be clearer and better knowne then those things which are expounded or defined. Now the definition of the true Church is, that it is the assembly of true beleeuers. Then before we can know which is the true church, we must know who are true beleeuers, and by consequence, which is true
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:11462:154"/> faith. Now if we will define the Church as <hi>Bellar.</hi> doth, which is, that the Church is the assembly of those which are ioyned together by confession of the Christian faith; we must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily know what is true Christian faith, before we know the true Church, seeing that true faith is a chiefe point where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to define the Church. From thence also it followeth that we must know Iesus Christ, that is, his nature and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, before we can know the true Church; for that faith in Iesus Christ, is of the very definition of the Church. But see here a Iesuiticall Doctor, that will haue vs to know the true Church before we know the true doctrine: and by consequence, before we know Iesus Christ. Which is a strange conceit, to imagine that a man may know which is the true Church, without knowing Iesus Christ; and who are true beleeuers, without knowing true faith.</p>
                  <p>Adde hereunto, that it is necessarie to know and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the word of God, before we can discerne the true Church, seeing that by the word of God onely we know that there must be a Church in the world. By the which, God who declareth vnto vs, that his will is that there should be a Church, declareth also what manner of Church he would haue it to be, and giueth vs markes to know it by.</p>
                  <p>Our Aduersaries themselues vnwittingly say the same, as often as they alledge the Scripture for themselues, &amp; ground the authoritie of their Church vpon the testimonies of the word of God. For thereby they presuppose, that the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the contents of the Scripture is necessarie, before they can know whether they haue the true Church, seeing they ground their Church vpon the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Adde hereunto, that there being diuers contrarie Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and but one word of God contained in the Scriptures; and acknowledged by all the Churches in the world; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidell that would become a Christian, but is in doubt to which Church he should yeeld himselfe; cannot determine thereupon, but by beginning with the knowledge of that which all Christians receiue and embrace, which is the holy Scripture.</p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:11462:154"/>
                  <p>And I cannot conceiue how in this doubt, which Church is the purest of all, it is possible to take any other marke or any other direction then the rule of puritie, which is the word of God. And that if there were any one, who before he had any knowledge of true religion, met with or found out the true Church, and ioyned himselfe with the good flocke, I say that such a man, as long as he is so, is not a true Christian. He is like a blinde man that layeth hold on the first man that reacheth his hand vnto him. Such a man hath no heresies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he hath no knowledge, and by consequence, no faith nor pietie. He deriueth his Religion from his birth, or from custome, or from the concourse of ciuill affaires. If he were borne in an other countrie, or if the State should alter and be changed, he would haue another religion: he followeth the true Church, without knowing whether it be the true Church, and is a Christian, and knowes not Christ.</p>
                  <p>Reade all the historie of the New Testament, and you shall neuer finde, that any man did acknowledge the true Church, before he was instructed in the doctrine of the Gospell. But on the contrary, we see that the Apostles preached Iesus Christ, and the doctrine of Saluation, and that the people by beleefe in that doctrine ioyned themselues to the Church, without making any other enquirie touching the markes of the Church.</p>
                  <p>If men haue maliciously made difficulties touching the knowledge of the true doctrine, that ought not to be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the obscuritie or incertainty of this Marke, but to the malice of men. For all difficulties laid aside, that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth cleare and manifest in the holy Scripture, hauing no need of interpretation, is sufficient to saluation. And besides that, they are difficulties which men may auoyde, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we must craue the aide and assistance of God, which he hath promised. But to know the true Church before we know the true doctrine, it is not onely difficult, but also im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible. For, how shall I know whether this Church is a true Church, and pure in faith, if I know not what the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of true faith is, nor what true doctrine is?</p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:11462:155"/>
                  <p>This appeareth by the impossibilitie and absurditie of the markes which our Aduersaries propound, whereby to know the true Church.</p>

                  <p>But if by Catholike they vnderstand Vniuersall, then that marke is false, and contrary to common sense.

So in the disputation betweene the Greeke and the Romane Churches, how should I know that the Church of Rome is vniuersall, seeing that there being a Greeke Church, it is a proofe that the Church of Rome is not vniuersall? And the Greeke Church also calleth it selfe Catholike, and the Patriarch thereof for aboue 900. yeares together was called Vniuersall.

For it was requisite to haue great alteration in religion, to bring to passe that the Bishop of one towne should become the earthly Monarch of all Christendome, and to surpasse the greatest Kings of the world in riches. Is it to be found, (I speake not of the vniuersall Church) that any particular Church in the first ages of the Church did exclude the people from the participation of the chalice? or that read the Scripture to the people in a language which they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood not? or that hath forbidden Christians to reade the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures without speciall licence? or that made pictures and representations of the Trinity? or that worshipped Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? or that called the virgine <hi>Mary</hi> Queene of heauen, and Lady of the world? or that beleeued that the Pope can dispose of Emperours and Kings? or that the Pope hath the superabundant satisfactions of Saints in the treasury of the Church, and that he can draw soules out of Purgatory? or hath adored the host with the diuine worship called Latria? Where is the least mention made in all Antiquity of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish Indulgences, of pardons of 800000 yeares, of holy graines, and of rosaries? of the least mention of the Court of Rome, of Cardinals, of the order of begging Friars? of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God without vnderstanding what a man saith? and that Bishops ought to take oathes of allegiance to the Pope,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:11462:156"/> vpon their admissions? Herein our aduersaries hold their tongues, and say nothing, and by their silence accuse Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to be ignorant of religion.</p>
                  <p>Besides that, a doctrine cannot be called ancient, which hath not bene so from the beginning.

But now this marke is vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because of the length of so many ages, and the confusion and contradiction of Histories, but specially because the chaires which draw their successions from the Apostles are now in discord and separated from communion. Among the which that of Rome which seeketh to draw her succession from Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> is condemned by the rest of the chaires, which also draw their Succession from Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that is, by the Church of Antiochia, and of Alexandria; among which
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:11462:156"/> the Church of Rome is the newest and the most corrupt, and condemned by all the rest. So that if we should stand vpon the succession of chaires, it will be hard to range it to the Church of Rome.</p>

                  <p>Adde hereunto that the pretended succession of the Pope, is partly broken off by heresies which haue defiled that chaire, &amp; by schismes which haue oftentimes cut off the line of that pretended succession and neuer was knit againe, as we haue proued in the booke of the Vocation of Pastors.</p>
                  <p>Adde hereunto, that the doctrine of the Church of Rome, is contrary to Saint <hi>Peters</hi> doctrine. The succession of the chaire, without succession of doctrine, is rather a subuersion of the chaire then a succession. We shall not be iudged by chaires at the latter day, but by the rules of the word of God. Chaires speake not, but men speake, who not onely speake lies in chaires, but also makes vse of chaires to tell lies, and seeke to authorise lying by the dignity of chaires and by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession.

For as touching the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Church they confesse that it is but small in number, in respect of the Pagans and infidels. But there being many particular Churches which contend together they will haue the greatest to be the best.

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:11462:158"/> wherein there is a great debate touching the principall point of religion, that is, which is the head and soueraigne of the Church, the Pope or Councels. For there can be no greater nor more important a quarell in any State, then to dispute and make question to whom the soueraigenitie belongeth. Also vpon the question whether the Pope may dispose of and command kings to be slaine, whereof there are infinite bookes on both sides written. And to speake of particular men, you shall hardly finde two men which in all things agree together, one is content to pray vnto God without calling vpon Saints, another beleeues not Purgatory, another mocks at pardons, another imagineth a manner to participate in the body of Christ otherwise then his Church beleeueth. But so a man will go to Masse, and allow of the Popes authoritie, all this is tollerated. In the meane time the Councell of Trent excommunicateth all those which disallow of any of the points of the Romish Churches doctrine. In such manner, that there are not any persons found in the Church of Rome, which are not excommunicated by the generall iugdment of their Church. He that would take the paines to reade the bull <hi>De Coena Domini,</hi> which the Pope publickly pronounceth and thundreth out euery yeare on Thursday before Easter, shall find, that the French kings and their Courts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the most part of French men, are therein excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated and made as blacke as a coale, by the strongest &amp; most solemne excommunication which is pronounced in the Church of Rome.

The conuertible proposition which he propoundeth, is, The true Church is that which hath true religion. Let vs see how he conuerts it: which is thus: Pure religion is that which is in the Church. This is not to conuert but to peruert. To conuert it truly, he should say, Pure religion is that which hath the true Church, which should be an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd proposition: whereby it appeareth, that falsly for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertible proposition, he putteth one which cannot be conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without spoyling.

                     <p>Of these three places, the first is very fit to proue that
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:11462:160"/> which our Confession saith, which is, that the true Church is that which conformeth her selfe to the word of God. For, whosoeuer groundeth himselfe vpon the Prophets and the Apostles, of necessity will conforme himselfe to their words, and will follow their instructions. And note, that there Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speakes of the body of the Church, which he likeneth to a building, saying, <hi>In whom all the building coupled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, groweth vnto an holy temple of the Lord.</hi> Thē if the Church be grounded vpon the doctrine of the Apostles, the doctrine of the Apostles must go first; and that as the true Church is grounded vpon the doctrine of the Apostles, so the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true Church, should be grounded vpon the knowledge of the Apostles doctrine.</p>
                     <p>The second place also is very fit for the same purpose: for God hath not ordained Prophets, Apostles, and Euangelists, to any other end, but that we should follow their word; and this subiection of the faithful consenting to obey their word, is that which ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The third place is very pertinent and effectuall to proue, that the knowledge of the Scriptures makes the faithfull, and by cons<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>quence, the true Church wise to saluation. Now the Church cannot be made wise to saluation by the word of God contained in the holy Scriptures, without following that word, and conforming it selfe thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Touching <hi>M. Arnoux,</hi> who in stead of acknowledging the pure word of God to be a marke which maketh the Church knowne, will haue that the Church maketh knowne to vs which is the pure doctrine: He sheweth thereby, that he conceiueth not what the state of the question is, nor the point of our difference. For the difficultie is, how among di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers Churches contrary in beleefe, a man may know the best, and that which propoundeth true doctrine. Therein, none of those Churches ought to be iudges, because they are parties: and therefore it is requisite and necessarie, that among those parties contēding together, there should be a common rule, which serueth to discerne the pure Church from the impure:
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:11462:161"/> Now there is nothing but the word of God which is the rule of puritie. I grant that the true and orthodoxall Church tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth pure doctrine, but we are at variance which is the true orthodoxall Church, whereof we will haue God, by his word, to be Iudge. But the church of Rome will be iudge in this cause, and will be both iudge and party: and to the end that she may not be contradicted by the word of God, hideth this word from the people, and forbiddeth them to reade the holie Scripture: and also saith, that she is the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible iudge of the Scripture, and of the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nce and the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Scripture. It is true that the orthodoxall Church teacheth the word of God, not as a Iudge, but as a witnesse and a guardian of the truth. But the word of God maketh the true Church to be knowne, with infallible authoritie of a Iudge, and ordaineth what the true Church ought to be.</p>
                     <p>Which is so certaine and true, that we should not know that God will haue a Church to be in the world, if the holy Scripture taught it not: which declaring that there must be Church, declareth also by what markes it shall be knowne, which is, if she hearkeneth to the voyce of the good Pastor, and followeth not a stranger: <hi>Iohn</hi> 10.4.5. And if she perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uereth in the word of God, <hi>Iohn</hi> 8.31.</p>
                     <p>Seeing there is but one holy Scripture, it will easily make vs know the pure Church: but there being many contrarie Churches, vnto which of them must we referre our selues touching pure doctrine? And how will she perswade a man (who to obey the Church of Rome, dares not looke into the holy Scriptures) that her doctrine is conformable to the word of God?</p>
                     <p>If the true Church doth beare witnesse that this is the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scripture, she doth it because she is bound to say so: but God is not bound to speake to vs in his holy word, which the Church must obey Now how can I know whether she obeyeth this word, if before I beleeue the Church, I do not know what the word is, nor what it commandeth to be done?</p>

                     <p>It is a great error to thinke that all that which the Creed or Symboles say of the Church, should be a marke whereby to know the visible Church. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Ephes. 5.25. saith, <hi>That Christ loued the Church.</hi> And in Canticles it is often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led welbeloued. And Hebrewes 12.23. the Church is called <hi>The assembly and congregation of the first borne, which is written in heauen.</hi> Would <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> haue the loue which Iesus Christ beareth to his Church, or to be written in heauen, to be markes whereby to discerne the visible Church? It is very true, that there is but one vniuersall Church; but doth it
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:11462:162"/> therefore follow that this word <hi>one</hi> is a proper marke to know the true Church from the false? seeing also that euery false Church is <hi>one?</hi> Adde hereunto, that <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> searcheth for the markes of the vniuersall visible Church, but this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Church likewise containeth the false. We haue also shewed, that vnitie, vniuersalitie, holinesse, and the succession of the Apostles, agree not with the Church of Rome. The Greeke and Syrian Churches boast that they haue these markes, in such manner, that the discord still continueth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till we come to the word of God, which endeth the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and makes the truth knowne. Therefore the Church of Rome hindreth the reading of it, and diminisheth the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority thereof.</p>
                     <p>Let vs see what places <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> setteth downe vnto vs. He saith,<note place="margin">One.</note> that the Church is called <hi>one,</hi> in Eph. 4.5. This is the verse, <hi>There is one Lord, one faith, one baptisme.</hi> Of the Church here is nothing spoken.<note place="margin">M. Arnoux falshood.</note> Thus you see already one falshood.</p>
                     <p>He saith that the Church is called <hi>holy,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Holy.</note> 1. Cor. 6.11. That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is falsly alledged.<note place="margin">Falshood.</note> The place is thus, <hi>And such were some of you, but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are iustified, in the name of the Lord Iesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is nothing spoken of the vniuersall Church. For in the vniuersall visible Church, all are not sanctified, ordinarily there are more wicked then good in it. This is a second false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
                     <p>He saith that the Church is called <hi>Catholicke,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Catholicke.</note> Marke 16.15. This also is falsly alledged.<note place="margin">Falshood.</note> The place is thus. And he said vnto them, <hi>Go ye into all the world, and preach the Gospell to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry creature.</hi> Of the Church nor of vniuersality there is nothing spoken. It may be that he thought these words <hi>all the world,</hi> &amp; <hi>all creatures</hi> signified the Catholicke Church. That is false, for by these words, Pagans and Infidels are also vnderstood, to whom the Apostles preached, and whereof the greatest part beleeued not their preaching. This is the third falshood.</p>
                     <p>He addeth, that the Church is called <hi>Apostolicall,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Apostolicall.</note> Psal. 10.18. That likewise is false,<note place="margin">Falshood.</note> the place is thus, <hi>To iudge the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therlesse and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:11462:162"/> oppresse.</hi> The lanterne of <hi>Iudas</hi> which is kept in S. <hi>Denis</hi> Church might with as good reason haue bene alledged to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. And it is not to be imagined that there is any fault in the cypher, for in all the Psalmes there is nothing spoken of the Apostolicall Church. Then this is the fourth falshood.</p>
                     <p>He saith, that the Church is called the <hi>Spouse of Iesus Christ,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Spouse of Iesus Christ.</note> Osee 2.19. To what purpose serues that, when here we speake of the markes of the visible Church? Is the coniunction and nearenesse of the Church with Iesus Christ a marke of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church? Is that a marke which is discerned by the eye? Adde hereunto that this honourable title belongeth princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally to the Church of the elect, to the which Iesus Christ hath ioyned himselfe, to make it a glorious Church without spot or wrinkle, Ephes. 5.27.</p>
                     <p>He addeth further, that in Math. 16.18. the Church is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>house of God:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">House of God.</note> although no mention of the house of God is found in that place, yet, let vs put the case that it were truly alledged. For to be the house of God is that a marke of the visible Church? Do those that are out of the Church see God dwelling therein? Adde hereunto, that there is no false Church which prerendeth not to be the house of God.</p>
                     <p>He goeth on and saith, that the Church is called <hi>visible,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">In the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew it is the 19. Psalme &amp; 4. verse. Falshood. <hi>Visible.</hi>
                        </note> Psal. 18.5. This is most false. The true place according to the Hebrew is thus, <hi>Their line is gone out through all the the earth, and their words to the end of the world: in them hath he set a tabernacle for the Sunne.</hi> Of the which Sunne, he after de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth the beauty, swiftnesse, and heate, but speaketh not of the visible Church. The vulgar translation saith, <hi>In sole posuit tabernaculum suum. He hath set his tabernacle in the Sunne.</hi> Which corruption being receiued, yet therein nothing is spoken of the visible Church. <hi>Sanctes Pagninus</hi> a Lucquois, and a Iacob in Friar translateth this place as we do, &amp; <hi>Arias Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus</hi> a Spanish Doctor doth the like. But <hi>Sixtus Senensis</hi> keeper of the Popes library reiecteth that exposition, and saith that the true and proper sence of those words is, that God hath set a tabernacle for the Sunne in heauen. So here you haue a fift falshood, and that ioyned with fopperie.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:11462:163"/> For what apparence is there to place visiblenesse among those markes which discerne the true Church from the false, seeing that the false Church also is seene, and that to be visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is also proper to a tree, or to an horse? The markes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men discerne one thing from another, ought to be proper vnto them. And what makes that against vs, which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Church to be visible?</p>
                     <p>He also saith, that the Church is called the <hi>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>round and pillar of truth,</hi> 1. Tim. 3.15. which is true, for it belongeth to the Church to defend and support the truth against errors. But what is that to the purpose, when we speake of the markes of the visible Church? Is the duty of the Church without the performance a marke of the Church? How absurdly should I speake, if I should say, that one of the markes to know a vertuous man from a vicious man, is, that the vertuous man ought to be wise?</p>
                     <p>Lastly, he saith that in Canticles 4.6.8.9. all these markes are there found together. Let the Reader peruse the places, and he shall not there find one trace or footstep of any of these markes.<note place="margin">Falshoods heapt one vpon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> Then this is the sixt falshood. Where is conscience? Is not this an abusing of the people? Doth the Doctor in this manner contend against the places noted in the margent of our Confession, by heaping vp so many falshoods in so few lines? But it is true, that lying cannot be defended but by lies, and by corrupting of the holy Scripture.</p>

               <q>In this Article we professe, that there where the

We hold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that all those which deale in such actions &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate therein, separate and cut themselues off from the body of Iesus Christ. Neuerthelesse, because that as yet there resteth some small traces of a Church in the Papacie, and that the substance of Baptisme still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth there: as also that the efficacie of Baptisme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendeth not vpon him which administreth the same: we confesse, that those which are baptized therein, haue no need of a second baptisme.

                     <hi>If all that be true, the Sonne of God is not yet come into the world, seeing that one of the principallest markes of his coming, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying of Idols. Now if by their reckoning the Romish Church be idolatrous, idolatrie was neuer in such credit, nor was so farre spread abroad as it is now, nor neuer had larger limits then it hath, and hath had since fiue or sixe ages, from whence they deriue the beginning of the corruptions of the Church.</hi>

                  <p>By the same reason I could proue, that there are no more vices nor errors in the world, because Iesus Christ is come into the world to take them away. <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> is but ill
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:11462:164"/> seene in histories, if he beleeueth that Iesus Christ by his comming hath wholly expelled and remoued idols. Seeing that since Iesus Christs time vntill now there hath alwayes bene an infinite number of Idolaters, as in China, India, &amp;c. And the Senate of Rome were Pagans and Idolaters 400 yeares after Iesus Christ, as we may see by <hi>Symmachus</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistles. Reade Reuelation, 9.20. and you shall see that the Spirit of God foresheweth, that men did not repent of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice which they did to Idols. This prophesie is not against vs, which neither adore, Idols, Images, Relicks, nor Sacraments; but adore God onely, Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leuate our hearts and adorations vp to heauen where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God: neither do we cut off the second commandement from the Law of God, wherein the seruice of Images in prohibited.</p>
                  <p>The aduersarie is likewise misaduised to presume that the Church of Rome is not Idolatrous, because it hath a precinct largely extended. Pagans and Infidels, which are manifest idolaters, haue much greater territories. The Church is a little flocke, Luke. 12.32. The gate is narrow which goeth in to life eternall, and few there are which find it, Math. 7.14. All the earth followeth the beast, Reuel. 13.4.</p>

                  <p>Our Confession saith, that the pure word of God is ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished out of the Papists assemblies.

It containeth not an historie of corruptions hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened since the Apostles time, but onely speaketh of rules how to shun those corruptions.

                  <p>That is not so. The Prophets say no such thing: you should alledge those places: for the Prophets knew well that the Church of Israel which was pure in the beginning, became idolatrous in Aegypt, Ezech. 20.7.8. They knew well that the children of Israel had worshipped the golden Calfe, <hi>Aaron</hi> himselfe the high Priest participating with them in the same sinne. They knew well that in the time of the Iudges, the
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:11462:165"/> people of Israel many times left the seruice of God to follow idolatrie. They knew that in the times of <hi>Achas</hi> and <hi>Manasses,</hi> idolarrie was erected in euery towne, and that <hi>Vrias</hi> the high Priest erected an idolatrous alter in the Temple, 2. Kings. 16. The Churches of Ierusalem and of Antiochia were pure in their beginning, and established, the one by Iesus Christ, the other by Saint <hi>Peter;</hi> and yet the Church of Rome holdeth that they were corrupted. Why may not the like happen to the Church of Rome, which is but a particular Church, which swalloweth vp the rest, and hath no particular promise that it shall neuer erre, but rather threatnings to be cut off, if she perseuer not in the bountifulnesse of God?

For he knowes well, that in those points the Church of Rome beares away the bell for prophanenesse of life and impietie, from all the Churches in the world. I speake
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:11462:165"/> not of particular persons, among whom I doubt not but that there are many that liue with ciuill honestie, and which thinke that in their religion they do seruice to God. I speake onely of publike orders. For in all other Churches, vices are accounted euils and corruptions, but in the Church of Rome, vices are accounted vertues, and are become lawes. None but the Church of Rome teacheth periurie, which by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of a<note n="*" place="margin">This is to be seene in the 19. Sessiō of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</note> Councell, declareth that men are not bound to keepe faith and promise with heretikes: and which teacheth that the Pope can dispense with oathes made to God.</p>
                  <p>None but the Church of Rome, by publike order, hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished the Stewes, and by law permitteth fornication.</p>
                  <p>None but the Church of Rome, giueth remission of sinnes, vpon condition to do euill, and which maketh the grace of God to be a reward of disloyaltie and wickednesse. So whilest the last warres of the League in Fraunce conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, the Pope gaue nine yeares of pardon to all those French-men that should reuolt from the obedience of the King. Those pardons were set vp vpon church doores, and on the corners of the streets.</p>
                  <p>None but the Church of Rome, maketh God an example of iniustice, and of deceitfull reuenge, in this, that they teach, that God pardoneth mens faults, but not the punishment for them, quitting our debt, but not the payment of the debt. For so he that shall haue receiued any iniurie, and hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned the partie that did it, may, after pardon giuen, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenged on him, and say, that he did pardon his offence, but not the punishment of the offence. For, why will they haue a man to be more iust and mercifull then God? We are too much inclined to do euill, without being incited thereunto by the example of God.</p>
                  <p>None but the Church of Rome, giueth way to crueltie, teaching that he is not a murtherer which with zeale to the holy mother Church of Rome, killeth one that is excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, which is Pope <hi>Vrbans</hi> doctrine, in the Canon <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicatorum, Causa</hi> 23. <hi>Quaest.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>None but the Church of Rome, dispenseth with subiects
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:11462:166"/> oathes of Allegiance to their Kings, and which inciteth them to rebellion, when it hath pleased the Pope to pronounce sentence of Deposition against a King.

                     <p>In this place Iesus Christ giueth not any power to <hi>Peter,</hi> but onely maketh a promise thereof. And that which he here promised, he giueth and conferreth it actually vpon him, Ioh. 20.22.23. where Iesus Christ speaketh thus to all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, saying, <hi>As my Father sent me, so send I you. Whosoeuers sinnes ye remit, they are remitted vnto them, and whosoeuers sinnes you retaine, they are retained.</hi> So in the actuall conferring of the power which he had promised, he made the Apostles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall. As also Matth. 18.18. he speaketh thus to all his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, <hi>Verily I say vnto you: whatsoeuer you binde on earth, shall be bound in heauen and whatsoeuer ye loose on earth shall be loosed in heauen.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And it is to be noted, that after that promise made to Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> the Apostles stroue among themselues for the superioritie, which they would not haue done, if they had vnderstood, that by those words the Lord had promised the superioritie to <hi>Peter,</hi> and would not haue vnderstood the commandement of the Lord. But <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> hath a conceit, that he vnderstandeth Iesus Christs words better then the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did. Also it is false, that Iesus Christ did declare Saint <hi>Peter</hi> to be the corner stone of the Church. He saith not, <hi>Super te Petrum,</hi> but, <hi>Super hanc Petram,</hi> he saith not, <hi>Ʋpon thee Peter,</hi> but, <hi>vpon this stone,</hi> which is cleare in the Greeke, where it is said: <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        </gap> in Greeke also signifieth a stone: and so the allusiō had had a good grace. But the holy Ghost guiding Saint <hi>Matthewes</hi> penn, thought it better to lose the grace of that allusion, then to let vs stumble at ambiguitie.</p>
                     <p>And certainly the Church of God is not grounded vpon a mortall man; it was a Church before S. <hi>Peter</hi> was, and at Saint <hi>Peters</hi> comming, it altered not the foundation. And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> being dead, the Church must of force haue changed her foundation, and thereby haue bene much impaited. We are grounded vpon the same foundation whereon Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was grounded, but he was not grounded vpon himselfe. And if it be so, that the Church spoken of in this place, should be the Church of the elect, if Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was the foundation of
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:11462:168"/> the elect, he was also the foundation of the election. Now it appeareth that here the Scripture speaketh of the Church of the elect, because Iesus Christ saith, that the gates of hell, that is, the power of the diuell, should not preuaile against it, and by consequence that neither the diuell, nor hell can cast any one of those which are of the Church, into hell. Which cannot agree with the vniuersall visible Church, whereof Sathan seduceth many:<note place="margin">Apocal. 13.7.</note> against the which the beast shall make warre, and ouercome it. Our aduersaries themselues say, that Antichrist shall abolish the Masse, and therefore he shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile against the Church of Rome.</p>
                     <p>Not that I denie, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> may be called the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the visible Church, so that by Saint <hi>Peter</hi> we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand his doctrine, in which sence the Fathers vnderstand it. But also in this sence all the Apostles equally are foundations of the Church: as it is said, Ephes. 2.20. <hi>And are built vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Iesus Christ himselfe being the chiefe corner stone.</hi> Note these words <hi>him selfe</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely set downe to discerne Iesus Christ from the Apostles, which are not foundations <hi>themselues,</hi> but in their doctrine.</p>
                     <p>Then this fundamentall stone is Iesus Christ, confessed by S. <hi>Peter:</hi> for Iesus Christ is commonly called the stone. As 1. Cor. 10.4. <hi>The rocke was Christ.</hi> And Psal. 118.22. Esay, 28.19. Rom. 9.33, and in many other places. So S. <hi>Augustine</hi> vnderstands it in his tenth Treatise vpon the first of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> saying. What meaneth this, Vpon this stone I will build my Church? Vpon this faith, vpon that which hath bene said, Thou art the Christ,<note place="margin">Super hanc confessionis Petram Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae aedificatio est. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

And in the Sermon of Pentecost, he said: Vpon this stone, &amp; not vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon <hi>Peter.</hi> For he built not the Church vpon men, but vpon the faith.

                     <p>If Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had not the dignitie to be the chiefe corner stone of the Church, as we haue already shewed, he had no successors in a dignitie which he had not.</p>
                     <p>But put the case that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had bene the head, and the foundation of the vniuersall Church: doth it from thence follow, that he had a successor in that dignitie? <hi>Moses</hi> was by God established to be the Prince, Law-giuer, and Priest in Israel, but left no successors, because God had not so ordained it. Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> had no successor. The rest of the Apostles had no successors in their Apostleship, why then should Saint <hi>Peter</hi> haue a successor in his? seeing that God in his Law did not ordaine it to be so? and that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his second Epistle which he wrote vnto the vniuersall Church, doth not will Christians to acknowledge the Bishop of Rome for his successor? Was there euer any kingdome or temporall or spirituall soueraignty established in the world, without lawes made touching the succession thereof, and touching the forme of chusing or succeeding? Here we haue no such thing, nor no declaration of the will of God vpon this matter.</p>
                     <p>Adde hereunto, that if Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was established head of the vniuersall Church, it was then when it was little, and compounded of a small number of men, which order could not be obserued when the Church began to spread abroad it selfe through out all the world. There are no one mans shoulders strong enough for so great a burthen. It would
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:11462:169"/> make a mans head giddie to be lifted vp so high.</p>
                     <p>And if after Saint <hi>Peters</hi> death, there had bene necessitie to haue a successor in the office of the head of the vniuersall Church, I make all men Iudges, that haue any sparke of free iudgement, whether that office ought not of right to apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> or Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> whom Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Gala. 2. calleth <hi>pillars,</hi> and which outliued Saint <hi>Peter</hi> long time, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then to deferre it to <hi>Linus</hi> Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> disciple, of whom we know nothing but the name? or to <hi>Clement,</hi> who saith in his<note n="*" place="margin">Can.

                     <p>At the least, it had bene reason, and very requisite to haue done those excellent Apostles that honour to haue called them, and to haue askt their aduice touching the choise of a head of the vniuersall Church. Who wil beleeue that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Citie of Rome had the credit, of their owne autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to giue a head to the Church of all the world, and that during the liues of the Apostles, and without making them acquainted therewith?</p>
                     <p>Especially after the death of all the Apostles, when by the witnesse of all Antiquity, Bishops, and among other the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Rome, were chosen by the voices of the people of the Citie: could the people of Rome giue a head to the Churches of Asia, Egypt, Persia, and the Indies, without acquainting them with it? No man will beleeue it, but he that hath a mind to be deceiued.</p>
                     <p>If Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was at Rome, and there erected the Church and the Bishopricke, as they say, the Bishop of Rome may be called Saint <hi>Peters</hi> successor, but not in the <hi>quality</hi> of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle or head of the vniuersall Church, but in <hi>quality</hi> of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of the Citie of Rome, which is the highest qualitie which the ancient Bishops of Rome tooke on them in their Epistles.

Did they draw soules out of Purgatorie? Did they giue pardons for seuen or eight hundred thousand years? Did they allow adoration of Images? Did they prohibit to giue the cup to the people, &amp; to reade the Scripture? Did they say seruice in an vnknowne tongue? Did they worship the host with diuine worship called Latria?

This accusation is of no small moment, seeing that, 1. Cor. 6.9. the Apostle saith, that <hi>Idolaters shall not inherit the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi> Therefore we cannot intreate of a matter of more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, because it concernes saluation, and exclusion out of the kingdome of heauen. If the word <hi>Idolatrie</hi> doth offend our aduersaries, we would haue them to consider, that we cannot call things otherwise then the word of God calleth them; and also to beleeue, that our intent is not thereby to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend them, but to make them know and feele their owne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: which cannot be done by flattering them, or by disgui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the truth. And that if they be offended at this which we say of them, God is much more offended at that which they do vnto him. And if for propounding the word of God vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, they hate vs, we neuerthelesse will not ceasse to take
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:11462:171"/> compassion on them, and lend them our helping hands, at least to discharge our owne consciences.</p>
                  <p>I say that in sixe things the Church of Rome committeth idolatry. First, by adoring the host which the Priest holdeth in his hands, and calling that God which is not so. Secondly, by attributing that honour to Saints which onely appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to God; by calling vpon them, by making them media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, by asking saluation of God by their merits, and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing that they know the hearts and thoughts of men. Thirdly, by calling the virgine <hi>Mary</hi> the inuentrix of grace. Queene of heauen, and Lady of the world: for the royalty and empire ouer all creatures belongeth to God onely. Fourthly, by adoration and worshipping of images. Fifthly, by adoring the crosse. And sixtly, by worshipping the bones, apparell, and other relickes of the dead. The first sort of ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, shall be spoken of in the end of this worke. The second and third sort hath bene declared and discoursed on at large in the 24. Article of our Confession. There remaine the three last, that is, adoration of images, of the crosse, and of relicks. Vpon all which in generall we say, that we call those idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which yeeld a worship and religious seruice to creatures, or that partly or wholly transport to creatures, that honour which is due to God. By which definition it appeareth, that the most holy and most excellent creatures may be transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med into idols by those that are superstitious: so farre, as that ancient Christians called the Arians idolaters, because de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Iesus Christ to be the eternall and soueraigne God, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse they called on him, and yeelded religious seruice vnto him. From whence it followeth, that those which ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Saints with such honours wherby God is dishonoured, do wrong to Saints by honouring them, seeing that as much as in them lyeth, they transforme them into idols.</p>

                  <p>Our Aduersaries, which make a controuersie about these words, thereby to hinder the examination of things, will haue men to translate the second commandement of God, in this manner; <hi>Thou shalt make no grauen Idoll, nor any resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of things which are in heauen, &amp;c.</hi> And say, that Idoll is the resemblance of a thing which is not, but that Image is the representation of a thing which is; wherein they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict their owne Bible.

What King will endure to haue his picture made like a Frog or an Ant? And yet the distance and difference betweene the greatest Monarch in the world, and the least creature that is, is not infinite, for that both the one and the other are finite. But betweene God which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, and a mortall creature, what excellencie soeuer it is of, the distance and inequalitie is infinite. For this our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries bring some small excuses, not for an answer, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they will not seeme to say nothing.</p>

                  <p n="5">5 They say, that in representing God, they intend not to represent his essence. But it is to no purpose to shew to what end men represent God by images, seeing the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment giuen by God, not to represent him by images, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall and without exception. Also it is certaine, that no man was euer so brutish, as to thinke he could represent the essence of God in a picture seeing y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> it is impossible to paint the essence of a man, or of the least beast that is. By this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction then it may by said, that the prohibition which God so expresly maketh (with thteatnings) not to represent him by any image, is made to no body, seeing that no man euer went about to represent the essence of God. And there is no Pagan idolater but may excuse himselfe by this meanes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 They adde, that the Scripture attributeth feete, hands, eyes, and mouth to God; and therefore that we may repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent God in the same forme. This argument hath as good reason as if they should say, Because the Scripture in words maketh figures, let vs also make images of stones; let vs paint God with wings, and in forme of a bird; or let vs paint him like a rocke, or like a fountaine, or like a Lion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Scripture saith that God couereth vs with the sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of his wings, and calleth him our rocke, the fountaine of life, and compareth him to a Lion. This reason therefore is without reason: for the word of God which attributeth feete, hands, and eyes vnto God, expoundeth it selfe, and oftentimes elsewhere declareth, that God is a Spirit, and that he is infinite. But the images of God expound not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and there are no other images that speake to preuent the error and their grosse conceits. The people of God, and all the Patriarkes and Prophets vnderstood not this subtilty; for from those figuratiue words whereby God spake vnto them, they drew no such strange consequences, neither tooke any liberty there by to erect images of God.</p>

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:11462:174"/> that we may paint God in the same forme wherein he appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.

Therefore we ought to do as the Church at that time did, and obey the commandement of God. For here we argue not what God hath done, but what God will haue vs to do. The commandements and not the actions of God, are the rules of our liues. It is by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements &amp; not by his apparitions that we shall be iudged at the latter day. It is mad religion to violate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, and to counterfeit his actions: as if a man should despise the Law of God and go about to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit thunder. And I cannot finde that God euer appeared in that forme wherein the Church of Rome represents him.

There are diuers images of Saints which are poorely clad: and there are diuers images of one Saint, some apparelled in silke, laid on with lace of gold, and which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes change their apparell; others dustie, and before whō they light not many candels.

                  <p>The naturall inclination of man hath hatched this error, but the subtiltie and pollicie of the Bishop of Rome hath bene the nurse thereof. For naturally man loueth images: little children loue babies, specially if they be finely clothed, and hauing set them in some eminent place, beare them I know not what <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>espect. This childish humor hath crept into religion, and as babies are childrens idols, so images and pictures are mens babies. For in regard that all our knowledge commeth by sense, man desireth to see an obiect of sensible deuotion: and will haue something to bind or prouoke his attention. Whereunto also the pleasure of the eye &amp; easinesse
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:11462:175"/> inuiteth him. For it is an easier thing to see pictures then to comprehend doctrines, and to forme prayers to the image of man, then to forme man to the image of God.</p>
                  <p>Popes by their subtilty haue dexterously serued their turns with this inclination, to draw the light of the Scripture from the people, that in a darke mistie night they might lay the foundation of their Empire. For the people did easily neglect instruction, when they fed them with recreation, and were v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to haue images in stead of sacred books, pictures for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and candles lighted at noone day, in stead of the light of the holy Scripture, which driueth away the obscuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of ignorance. And we see in Histories, that as fast as igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance increased, images also multiplied, and the Popes Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was strengthened.</p>
                  <p>Against this permission to fill Churches with images, we haue the commandement of God, which not only forbiddeth to serue images or to worship them, but also to make them. For the first table of the Law is expresly made to order reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the seruice of God. Then I say, that in matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, God forbiddeth to make images. The words are very direct: <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen image, nor the likenesse of any thing that is in heauen aboue, nor in the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, nor in the waters vnder the earth: Thou shalt not bow downe to them, nor worship them.</hi> There it is manifest, that in matter of religion and piety, he forbiddeth two things, one to make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny image or likenesse of things that are in heauen or earth: the other, to bow downe to them, or worship them. He saith not, <hi>Thou shalt make no any grauen image to worship it,</hi> but he saith, <hi>Thou shalt make no grauen image, nor worship it.</hi> For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the end for the which images are forbidden in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of religion, is for feare lest men should fall into idolatrie by worshipping them, yet God knowing that man is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally giuen to idolatry, did not onely forbid the worship of images, but also the making of them for any religious vse, and hath prohibited the meanes and inducements thereunto for feare of the end. The like prohibition is made, Leuit. 26.1. <hi>You shall make you no idols, nor grauen image, neither reare you vp
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:11462:176"/> a standing image, neither shall you set you vp any image of stone in your land to bow downe to it. For I am the Lord your God.</hi>

                  <p>Our aduersaries reasons to the contrary, are rather excuses and shifts then proofes.

                  <p>They also say, that <hi>Moses</hi> by Gods commandement made a serpent of brasse, which was a figure of Iesus Christ, in that it healed the bitings of the old serpent, which is the diuell. But speaking in this manner, they make answer vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and confute their images. For they say that <hi>Moses</hi> made that serpent by the expresse commandement of God, but they set vp images in the Church without Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, and against his commandement. And yet it is false that the serpent was properly an image of Iesus Christ, (howsoeuer it were a type of Christs grace:) for what resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance had the forme of a serpent with the humanity of the Sonne of God? Considering also that our aduersaries say, that idols are figures of things which are not, but that images are figures of things that are. But then the humanity of Christ was not; and therefore the brazen serpent could not be an image of Iesus Christ: howbeit the sauing vertue which God displayed in the serpent, was an example and a figure of the sauing efficacie of Iesus Christ, &amp; of the healing of our soules by his vertue. The figure was not in that heape of brasse, but in the healing.</p>
                  <p>They also alledge the image, of the Cherubins or Angels, placed vpon the Arke by Gods commandement. But what makes that for the images of Saints, which God hath not cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded? And yet it is false that those Cherubins were the images of some Angels: for let them tell me of which of the
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:11462:177"/> Angels those Cherubins were figures? As also that the resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of Angels which are inuisible and incorporeall, cannot be made in any corporall figure. Then we must say, that those Cherubins were not the images of any Angels, but symboles and characters of their office, in the same manner as men paint vertues and vices. So we paint Enuie leane, Pride swolne and puft vp, Iustice with a sword and a paire of ballance. Which symbolicall pictures produced diuers Saints, as S. <hi>Christopher,</hi> S. <hi>Margaret,</hi> and S. <hi>George</hi> which were not the images of any Saints that euer liued in the world, but figures and characters of Christians and combats of faith, as <hi>Baronius</hi> in his booke of Martyrs is oftentimes constrained to confesse.</p>
                  <p>Being put from these weake proofes, they alwayes returne to this, that we must translate, <hi>Thou shalt make no grauen idoll,</hi> and not, no grauen image.

For hauing taken one out of the ten commandements of the Law, they cut the last in two, making the not coueting of a mans wife, the ninth commandement, and the not coueting of the house, the man seruant, and the maid seruant, &amp;c. the tenth. By this meanes they might make 14. commandements, if on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery thing whereof God forbiddeth the coueting they would make a commandement apart. But God, by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidence hath taken all excuse from our Aduersaries: for in the 20 of Exodus, the not coueting of our neighbours wife, which they make the ninth commandement, is thrust into the middle of the tenth, and put after the not coueting of thy neighbours house, whereby it followeth, that according to the Church of Rome, in the 20. of Exodus there is no ninth commandement.</p>

And finally, for conclusion setteth downe this determination, which is found in the seauenth Act: We hold that we must adore, and salute the Images of the virgine <hi>Mary</hi> the vndefiled mother of God, and of the
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:11462:178"/> glorious Angels, and of all the Saints. And that if any one be of a contrarie opinion, and doubteth or wauereth tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the adoration of venerable Images, our holy and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Synode holdeth him to be accursed. In the same Councell there is an Epistle written by Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> to <hi>Thae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rasius</hi> Patriarch of Constantinople, where the said Pope faith thus; Let your Holinesse perseuer to serue and<note n="*" place="margin">Imagines omnium San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas vestra co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere &amp; ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rare pergat.</note> adore the Images of all the Saints. There also Images are aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to such degree of excellencie and holinesse, that in the fourth action it is said, That<note n="*" place="margin">Vt etiam meo iudicio cum sanctis Euangelijs &amp; veneranda cruce aequiua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leant.</note> Images are of like and equall value with the holy Gospell. Also, <hi>Maior est Imago quàm o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio.</hi> And, to the end that men might paint Angels, it is said in the fift Action, that The Church<note n="*" place="margin">Ecclesia sentit non om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino esse cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris expertes &amp; inuisibiles, verùm tenui corpore prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditos aerio siue igneo.</note> holdeth, that Angels are corporeall and not inuisible, hauing a body either of aire, or of fire.</p>
                  <p>Now, to the end that by <hi>adoring</hi> we should not onely vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand to <hi>reuerence, honour</hi> or <hi>respect,</hi> but also to yeeld and to giue them religious worship, the Patriarch <hi>Tharasius,</hi> which was President at that Councell, pronounced this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the 6. Action: All those which confesse that they reuerence Images, &amp; neuerthelesse refuse to adore them, are reproued by the holy father <hi>Anastasius</hi> to be hypocrites: for when they refuse that adoration, which is a signe or marke of honour, it is manifest that they do the contrary, that is, that they speake iniuriously of the Saints.</p>
                  <p>Following this doctrine, our Aduersaries haue written di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers bookes <hi>De cultu Imaginum:</hi> Of the worship of Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> in the 22. chapter of his booke of Images, will haue them to be adored, not onely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of that which they represent, but also in themselues; saying, The ordinarie adoration which men giue to exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Images, is in themselues, and properly. And in the 21. chapter he setteth downe this maxime in great letters, saying, that<note n="*" place="margin">Imagines Christi, &amp; Sanctorum venerandae sunt, non so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum per acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, vel im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriè, ita vt ipsae terminēt venerationem vt in se consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derantur, &amp; non solùm vt vicem gerunt exemplaris.</note> the Images of Christ, &amp; of Saints ought to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, not onely by accident, and improperly, but in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and properly: in such manner, that the worshipping is limited to the Image considered in it selfe, and not onely

This superstition beganne already to enter into the mindes of some particular persons in Saint <hi>Augustines</hi> time, of whom he speaketh thus, Libr. 1. cap. 34. of the Customes of the catholike Church: saying,<note n="*" place="margin">Noui multos esse sepulcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum &amp; pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarum adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores.

                  <p>Against this so prodigious an abuse, and so lamentable blindnesse, we haue the commandement of the Law of God, which our Aduersaries haue put out of their Ladies houres and seruices; <hi>Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen image, nor the likenesse of any thing which is in heauen aboue, nor in the earth below, nor in the waters vnder the earth, thou shalt not bow downe to them nor worship them.</hi> This word pronounced with thunder and lightening, as yet thundreth against idolatrie, and lighteneth darknesse. So Iesus Christ said to the diuell, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him onely shalt thou serue.</hi> Reade Leuit. 26.1.</p>
                  <p>Against this so cleare and manifest word of God, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with terrible threatnings, our aduersaries shroud themselues with weake reasons, as if a man should hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the water, against raine.</p>
                  <pb n="322" facs="tcp:11462:180"/>
                  <p n="1">1 They contest about the words Idoll and Image, but the Bible of their owne translation saith, <hi>grauen image</hi> and <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation.</hi> And the general prohibition not to make any resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of things which are in heauen and in earth, (which is added thereunto,) stops all euasions whatsoeuer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They say y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> they reserue all diuine worship called Latria vnto God &amp; yeeld an inferior religious worship called Dulia, to Saints and their images: but the word of God speaketh but of one religious seruice, and that is to be performed to God onely. When the prohibition to adore Images is generall in the Law, it belongs not to man to make any restraints or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions against it, drawne out of their owne braines. Such distinctions are to be receiued when they are contained in the word of God. It belongs to the law maker, and not to subiects, to make exceptions vpon the law. Now our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries neither bring places out of the Scripture, commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, nor any examples, which in any sort do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue or establish religious adoration of creatures. But on the contrarie, in the Scripture this religious seruice which our aduersaries call Dulia, is expresly reserued to God onely, with an expresse prohibition to attribute it to any other but to God. So in Sam. 1.7. The Greeke hath, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: Direct or prepare your hearts to the Lord, and giue Dulia to him onely. And <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 4.8. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Then when you knew not God you gaue Dulia,</hi> that is, you serued those who by nature were no Gods. And whosoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer vnderstandeth Greeke, knoweth that Latria is lesse then Dulia; for Latria simply signifieth seruice of honour, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and subiection; but Dulia, (besides that,) importeth a slauish seruitude. Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his 20 booke, cap. 21. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Faustus</hi> a Manichee, &amp; in his Questions vpon Genesis, lib. 1. cap. 61. vseth this distinction, but in contrary sence to our aduersaries. For he saith, that Dulia is giuen to men that are aliue▪ and consequently by the word Dulia he vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth no religious seruice. And in fine, who seeth not the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ruersitie of this proceeding? For after they haue suppressed
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:11462:180"/> the second commandement of the Law, if any one make it knowne to the people, they set before them a forked distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of words in bad Greeke, which the people vnderstand not, and which those that are wise know to be mistaken, rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vp a cloud of dust with their Latria, Dulia, and Hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulia, to escape through this thicke mist.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 If these two sorts of religious adoration were receiued, the proofes which the Scripture vseth to proue the diuinity of Christ, would be weake and of no force. As when the Apostle, Hebr. 1.6, proueth Christs diuinitie by this which he writeth of him, <hi>That all the Angels of God worship him;</hi> the enemies of his diuinitie would say, that there he speakes of an inferior adoration, and which may be attributed to a creature.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 They say, that the honour which men do to Images, turneth to the honour of that which they represent; which is the speech of all idolaters. So <hi>Michaes</hi> mother, Iudges 17.3. determining to make a molten Image in the house of God, said, <hi>I had wholly dedicated the siluer vnto the Lord from my hand, for my sonne to make a grauen Image.</hi> And therupon <hi>Micha</hi> perswaded himselfe that God would blesse him. It appeareth by the 5 and 6 verses of the 18 chapter, that the prayers made before that Image were directed vnto God. The same excuse a Pagan made kneeling on his knees before an Image, as Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> saith vpon the 113. Psalme, saying, I worship not the Image, but thereby I represent vnto my selfe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of that which I should adore.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 If we consider what honours men yeeld and giue vnto Images of Saints, we shall finde that the honour is properly done to the Image, and that the Saint is neuer the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored; and that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> hath reason to say, that the Image is worshipped for it selfe. For when they clothe an Image, the Saint is not adorned thereby; if they offer to an Image, the Saint hath no part thereof; if they set vp candles lighted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an Image, the Saint is not lighted therewith; if any man speakes to an Image, the Saint esteemeth himselfe to be no more honored then if a King should thinke himselfe to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, when a man speaketh to his picture before his face.</p>
                  <pb n="324" facs="tcp:11462:181"/>
                  <p n="6">6 The abuse is euident, in that our aduersaries to vntwine themselues, twist intricate cords of darke words, giuing vs an adoration of Latria, Dulia, and Hyperdulia, and each of them either absolute or relatiue; in such manner, that there are sixe sorts of religious adoration which the people neither vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand nor practise, who falling downe before an Image, come thither with all their deuotion, and diuide not their intents into so many parts. Whosoeuer shall enter into the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of these adorations, shall find that in them there is not onely deceit and intricatenesse, but also manifest foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: for the last refuge of our aduersaries is, to say, that the adoration of Images is a relatiue adoration, and which hath regard to the thing represented by the Image. But that is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for to adore an Image relatiuely, is to adore the Image; and to adore an Image, hauing a regard to the Saint which it representeth, is no adoration of the Saint. And seeing that the adoration of the Image is relatiue, and the adoration of the Saint is absolute and not relatiue, it followeth, that the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Saint, and the adoration of his Image are two sorts of adoration. And which is more, If this relatiue adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be receiued, there is no creature in the world but it may be adored. So men may adore and worship the Sunne, and the Moone, and beasts, and trees, and say that such adoration is relatiue to God, &amp; that they adore them because of him that created them, and in respect of him.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Adde hereunto, that all these distinctions onely serue to shew what the intent of the Church of Rome is, but not to ground this intention vpon the word of God, nor to shew that God or the Saints approue this relatiue adoration. For if it were lawfull to worship and adore Saints, yet before we should adore their Images with relatiue adoration, it were good to be assured that the Saints will be honoured in that sort. Seeing it is not likely that a king would thinke himselfe to be honoured by him that should do reuerence to his pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, or that should speake to his cloke, although he should say, that the honour he doth is relatiue, and the reuerence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectiue.</p>
                  <pb n="325" facs="tcp:11462:181"/>
                  <p n="8">8 They adde, that the abuse offered to an Image redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to him that is represented by that Image; whence, say they, it followeth, by a reason drawne from cōtraries, that the honour which is done to an Image, is an honour to him that is represented thereby. I answer, it is false, that the disgrace done to an Image, doth alwayes disgrace him that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented thereby: for oftentimes he which is represented, hateth that representation. So the King ordaineth that his Image stamped vpon false money shall be cut in peeces, and molten. The Israelites worshipped the brazen serpent in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God▪ and yet <hi>Ezechias</hi> did well to breake downe that serpent; for it is not credible that those which worshipped that brazen serpent did beleeue that a peece of brasse was the soueraigne God: but they referred an inferiour adoration vnto it, in remembrance of the vertue which God had shewed thereby.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 They mend the matter much, by saying that they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship not the Images of false gods, as the Pagans did, but the Images of the friends and seruants of God. For we must not transport that religious seruice which is due to God onely, to his friends nor to his enemies. If it be euill to honour euill things, it is euill to abuse good things, and to vse Gods friends to prouoke him to iealousie. Idolatrie in the Scripture is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led adultery. A woman is not excusable, although she giueth her body adulterously to none but to her husbands friends. Then this excuse shall be allowed, when they haue proued that God will haue the Images of his seruants to be adored.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 They also alledge a number of false miracles, done by Images. But if they were true, doth it follow y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> we must adore all that wherby God hath done miracles? Then we must adore the asses iaw which <hi>Samson</hi> vsed, <hi>Moses</hi> rod, and the water of Iordan which healed <hi>Naaman,</hi> and many such like things.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 Wanting reasons, they haue recourse to the Scripture, hoping that that will serue them without reason. The second Councell of Nice, and Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> which expresly made a declaration fot the defence of that Councel, with a ridiculous subtiltie collected an heape of places out of the Scripture for
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:11462:182"/> the adoration of Images: as in the second of Cant. it is said, <hi>Shew me thy face,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 6.</note>
                     <hi>&amp; let me heare thy voyce.</hi> In the second of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesis it is said, <hi>God made man after his own image.</hi> And Exod. 18 <hi>Moses</hi> bowed downe to <hi>Iethro</hi> his father in law. And Rom. 15. <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Act 4. Act. 6.</note>
                     <hi>That all things which are written, are written for our instruction.</hi> And Psalme 47, <hi>As we haue heard, so we haue seene.</hi> And Luke. 18, <hi>No man after he hath lighted a candle, set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it vnder a bushell.</hi> Vpon these places those reuerend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers grounded the adoration of Images. They forgot <hi>Goliah</hi> combat with <hi>Dauid,</hi> and <hi>Samsons</hi> foxes, for those may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged to as good porpose for the adoration of Images. Whosoeuer doth not acknowledge the absurditie of these proofes, is blinder then images themselues.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 New commers vse other weapons. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the 12 chap. of the booke of Images,<note place="margin">Imagines Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubin super arca existen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes necessariò adorabantur ab ijs qui ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cam adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant.</note> saith, that the Iewes worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the Cherubins placed vpon the Arke. First I say, if that be true, it must needs be that God commanded it, but that is no where to be found. Secondly, if the Israelites adored the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins, they would much more haue adored the Angels figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as they say, by those Cherubins; which before we haue shewed to be false. Thirdly, if the Israelites adored the two Cherubins placed vpon the Arke, then the Cherubins must needs haue bene the Images of some certaine Angels, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they should haue adored they knew not what. In the Church of Rome it selfe, they worship not any Image whose name they know not, and what Saint it representeth: but those Cherubins had no names, nor were the figures of any particular Angels. Then to worship them had bene a seruice done to an vnknowne Cherubin, as in Athens they worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the vnknowne God. Fourthly, adde hereunto, that if the Israelites adored those Images, then it must needs be that they saw them. But the Cherubins were shut vp in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie, and the people saw them not, no more then those that were painted in the curtaines in the holy place. And for the space of 500 yeares and more after <hi>Salomons</hi> time, the people saw them not. God by taking them away from the peoples sight, preuented idolatrie. Fiftly and lastly,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:11462:182"/> put the case, that the people did adore the Arke, (which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse is false) yet thereby it followeth not, that they adored the Cherubins placed vpon the Arke.

But when we speake of things insensible, to kneele downe before an altar, or before a mountaine, is not to adore the altar or the mountaine: specially in matter of religious adoration, which God reserued to himselfe onely, and which is enioyned by his commandement.</p>

                  <p>But by the Crosse of Christ I do not vnderstand a peece of wood, but the sufferings and passion of our Sauiour, Colos. 1.18.19. it is said, <hi>For it pleased the Father by him to reconcile all things to himselfe, through peace made by that bloud of the Crosse.</hi> God hath washed our soules in his bloud, and buried our sinnes in his death. There is nothing sweeter to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences then the remembrance of this bitternesse, nothing more honourable then this reproch.</p>
                  <p>Ancient Christians in <hi>Tertullians</hi> time, that is 200 yeares after the birth of our Lord, marked their foreheads with the signe of the Crosse, to witnesse that they were not ashamed of the Crosse of Christ. Not long after they proceeded to paint the figure of the Crosse. The <hi>Labarum</hi> or standart borne in the wars before the Emperors of Rome, namely before <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> was made like a Crosse. But <hi>Constantine</hi> added thereunto the name of Christ, which made some say, that <hi>Constantine</hi> fixed the signe of the Crosse in his standart. Kings made that signe to be stamped vpon their moneys, and carried it in the flags of their Christians ships. Vntill that time there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be disliked therein.</p>
                  <p>But when deuotion began to degenerate and turne to superstition, euery age adding some new thing, after that
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:11462:183"/> men had once learned to make wisedome or comelinesse a rule, in stead of subiecting themselues to the rule of the word of God, the signe of the Crosse made both in the aire, and painted, did insensibly change his nature. Men began to make the signe of the Crosse in the aire by forme of coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to driue away diuels: and to make a precise multitude of Crosses vpon the host, and vpon the chalice by order; and if a Priest failed in that number, the mysterie was spoyled. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third in his booke of the Mysteries of the Masse, cap. 58. saith,<note n="*" place="margin">Efficit super ea crucis sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naculum, vt per crucis vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutem omnis conatus diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licae maligni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis effugiat, ne contra sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotem vel sacrificium a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquo modo praeualeant.</note> That the Priests make signs of the Crosse vpon the host to withstand the force of diuels, lest they should preuaile against the Priest, or against the host, which is Iesus Christ, (if we will beleeue it.) This did come in good time to Iesus Christ. It is no small benefit that a Priest doth to his God to defend him with signes of the Crosse made in the aire against the force of the diuell.</p>
                  <p>With an abuse much worse then that, they adore little peeces of wood, which they say to be peeces of the wood of the true Crosse, with diuine worship called Latria, that is, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne adoration which belongeth to God onely;<note n="**" place="margin">Thomas <hi>3</hi> parte.

                  <p n="1">1 Then to begin with adoration of peeces of the Crosse, <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 14.13. saith, that <hi>whatsoeuer i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> not of faith is sinne:</hi> and speaketh this concerning the vse of meates, in which that a man sinne not, he will haue him to vse them in faith, that is to say, with assurance that God liketh that which he doth therin, &amp; that it is not contrary to his word: by greater reason then, we must haue this assurance in matters of adoration, and when question is made touching the yeelding of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous seruice to the creature. For first, how shall a man be assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that that chip of wood is a peeece of the true Crosse? see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if the wood of the Crosse which at this day is kept in relickes, were all put together in a heape, it would be wood enough to loade fiftie carts? Specially seeing there was a publicke trafficke made of that wood in our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers times, and that the same wood is distributed abroad like merchandise? In the yeare of our Lord 1239. <hi>Iohn de Brennet</hi> calling himselfe king of Ierusalem, hauing need of money, sold the Crowne of thornes to <hi>Lewis</hi> the ninth king of France, a meeke, vpright, and religious Prince according to the time, but easie to be circumuented: and the true Crosse to the Venetians, who sold the same againe for twice the value that they paid for it, to the said king <hi>Lewis:</hi> who for those relicks onely caused the holy Chappell in the pallace of Paris
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:11462:184"/> to be built to keepe them in.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Secondly, it is impossible to worship peeces of wood with assurance that God liketh of that adoration, seeing that God hath not commanded it, and that there is not one word spoken thereof in the Scripture: besides that God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to worship and serue any other but himselfe, as we haue proued in the precedent Section, and that the Prophets in all their Prophecies condemne those that worship wood and stone.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Adde hereunto, that if a peece of wood which men by coniecture suppose to be a peece of the true Crosse, ought to be adored with religious worship, much more the whole Crosse. And if at this day a peece of rotten worme eaten wood ought to be worshipped, by greater reason the whole Crosse ought to haue bene adored when it stood vpright, and was yet bloudy and hote with the bloud of Iesus Christ: and yet the Apostles did not then adore it, nor commanded the faithfull to adore it. It had bene an easie matter for euery one of them to haue cut a peece thereof to beare about them, to serue them for a preseruatiue against euill aire, against thunder, and against the diuels; but they neuer thought vpon it. And not onely they, but also the Christians after them for the space of three hundred yeares, left that Crosse, without once troubling themselues to seeke for it. Certainly our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries by their scrupulous dilligence accuse the Apostles of carelesnesse and negligence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the Booke of Images, cap. 20 and 22, percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that in it there is an abuse, opposeth himselfe against that multitude of Doctors who will haue the Crosse to be worshipped with diuine worship called Latria, which is due to God and will haue the Crosse to be worshiped with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour worship, by that meanes making the worshipping of the crosse to be another worship then that wherewith men worship the crucifixe, which ought to haue soueraigne worship. And hereby he troubled the imagination of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who worshipping the Crosse, thinke they do but one worship but <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will haue them to do two at one time,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:11462:185"/> and to cut their deuotion in two peeces. But how soeuer he pretend to adore the Crosse with inferiour religious seruice, yet still he yeeldeth religious seruice to the creature, and so incurreth that punishment set downe in the Law of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those that serue the creature in stead of seruing God onely.</p>
                  <p>It is to no purpose for them to say, that the wood of the true Crosse is to be worshipped, because it touched the body of Iesus Christ. If that be so, that part of the Crosse which touched the body of our Lord, ought to be more worshipped then that part which touched it not. And by that reason we must worship the ground whereon Christ went, and the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wherein he was baptized, and their handes that strooke him, and <hi>Iudas</hi> mouth that kissed him. And we must therupon haue some commandement of God, to worship those things which touchted the body of our Lord.</p>
                  <p>Certainly if the body of our Lord by being touched did sanctifie insensible things, in such manner as to make them worthy of worship, much more would he haue sanctified those, who bearing great loue vnto him, had touched him. Then why would he haue depriued <hi>Marie Magdalen</hi> of that grace,<note place="margin">Ioh. 20.17.</note> saying vnto her, <hi>Touch me not, for I am not yet ascended to my Father?</hi> The Church of Rome doth not worship emptie chalices, although they beleeue that the bloud of Christ hath bin in them. It doth not worship the Priest when it beleeueth that he hath Iesus Christ in his stomacke. And certainly after the death of a Priest, it is a wonder that his stomacke which was wont to be the ordinarie receptacle of Iesus Christ, is not layed vp among Relickes, and consecrated for that touching.</p>
                  <p>Touching the adoration of the Image of the Crosse, we haue already condemned it to be idolatrie, by all that which we formerly produced against adoration of Images. And if it be idolatrie to worship the Image of a liuing thing, much more to worship the Image of a senslesse thing. And I would gladly know, to whom they speake, when in the Romish Church they say, <hi>I salute thee wood.</hi> Do they speake to Iesus
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:11462:185"/> Christ? Iesus Christ is not wood. Do they speake to the wood? That wood vnderstands them not. Do they speake to that wood in honour of Iesus Christ? That whereunto men speake in honour of Iesus Christ, ought to vnderstand what a man saith. No man (if he be not mad) doth speake to the wood of the kings chaire in honor of the king. But on the contrary, he were worthy to be bound with <hi>Hyppocrates</hi> bands, that speaketh to a painted chaire, and doth reuerence thereunto. That is it which is done in the Romish Church: where they not onely speake to the Crosse, but also to the Image of the Crosse, adoring it.</p>
                  <p>To be short, we must alwaies haue recourse to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, and to the prohibition to make any I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, nor the likenesse of things which are in heauen or in earth, nor to fall downe before them, nor to do any worship vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Touching this custome of carrying a peece of the wood of the true Crosse about men, note by the way, that the nature of false religions is to change vertues into outward shewes, and necessary piety into superfluous ceremonies. And so to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the commandement of our Sauiour, that will haue vs to beare his Crosse; &amp; for example, in the Church of Rome they beare a peece of wood hanging about their necks. They car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the Crosse hanging down vpon their bellies, but that bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is an enemy to Iesus Christ. But touching the true Crosse wherof Iesus Christ speaketh, which is affliction for the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, the Church of Rome makes vs beare that: persecuting those which say the Crosse of Christ is our onely satisfaction, our onely merit, and our onely propitiatory sacrifice.</p>

<pb n="334" facs="tcp:11462:186"/> is not questionable: for if with a commendable curiositie we visite the Sepulchers of ancient Pagan Emperors, and persons of great fame, either for military vertues, or knowledge in good learning, and doing so we are not blamed: how much more willingly would we see the tombes of the Apostles, and of thoses organs of the holy Ghost, which yet speake now after they are dead? And if their sepulchers were in an vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent place, or exposed to the comtempt and disgrace of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, it were a godly duty and a good worke, to transport them into some more conuenient and sure place. If <hi>Vigilantius</hi> said, that the bones of Saints ought to be cast vpon dunghils; &amp; if <hi>Hierome</hi> did truly and without passion report the opinion of that person, there is not one of vs but would abhorre those profane words. It is true, that our aduersaries obiect against vs, that during the troubles and ciuill warres, we burnt the Saints relickes, and melted the shrines wherein their bodies lay: But if those relickes had bene true relickes, and worthy of reuerence, yet they do wrong to impute that to the religiō which was done by the insolency of certaine souldiers, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of a great part were of the Romish Church; &amp; seruing those that first hired them, had authority among ours to haue part of the booty. They ought also to remember, that those things were done by the souldiers without warrant frō the Church, to reuenge those massacres and burnings which were done vpon and against vs many yeares before we thought vpon our owne defence. It is a small matter to spoyle Churches, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of burning and massacring of the faithfull, which are the temple of God. And it is an hard &amp; a difficult thing, when men are once entred into armes, to retaine and hold them that are prouoked to anger within the bounds of mediocritie. But the chiefe point is, that all those relickes which were in that manner dispersed, were of the same nature with those which are yet left, that is, false relickes of true Saints, or true relickes of false Saints that liued not long since, and were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding to the Pope for their title of Saints. Which if those that worshipped them had buried in perpetuall obliuion, they had thereby healed Christendome of a great wound and had
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:11462:186"/> abolished strange superstition. Adde hereunto, that by the dissipation of relickes obiected vnto vs, the number of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes is rather increased then diminished. For soone after they forged others in greater number, which being newer and lesse vsed, ought to be of greater value, and haue more vertue.</p>
                  <p>Who could here declare the enormitie of this abuse? In the Church of Rome they adore bones old clothes, milke, and haires: they speake vnto those relickes, they kisse them, they perfume them with incense they offer vnto them, and they carrie them about in procession. When they shew them vnto the people, alwaies the basin is hard by, whereinto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery one throwes a peece of money.

The catechisme of the Councell of Trent, in the exposition of the third commandement, approueth the custome to sweare by the relickes of Saints. Now to sweare by any thing, is to take it for a witnesse of the puritie of our conscience, &amp; for a reuenge in case of periurie: which belongs onely vnto God, whose commandement in the sixt of Deuteronomie is thus, <hi>Thou shalt feare the Lord thy God, and shalt serue him, and sweare by his name.</hi> This was the forme and manner of an oath vsed in Israel, <hi>The eternall liueth,</hi> and, <hi>As true as God liueth,</hi> &amp;, <hi>I call God to witnesse.</hi> But they neuer sware by the creature. It is a friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous excuse to say, that to sweare by relickes, is to sweare by God which hath sanctified them: for by the same reason we
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:11462:187"/> may sweare by the Sunne, and by heauen, and by the earth, and excuse our selues and say, that we vnderstand by them God which created those things. As also when they speake to those relickes, worshipping them, they say things vnto them which are not agreeable vnto God. When they say, God preserue thee triumphant wood, they speake not to God, which is not wood. Or if men speake to wood in honour of God, that thing whereunto one speaketh in honour of God, must alwayes vnderstand that which is spoken vnto it. The worship of relickes ought to be relatiue, so the greater part of our aduersaries say. Then to adore relickes, is not to adore God, for we must adore God with absolute adoration, and for the loue of God onely. So the prayer which they make to the Iron point of the speare, is spoken in termes which are not agreeable with Iesus Christ; for after they haue said vnto it,<note place="margin">In hymno, Aue ferrum trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phale.

To these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes the people go with such feruent desire, that the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of God is key-cold in respect of that. All the Angels together haue not the fourth part of the honour which the people in Paris giue to the shrines of Saint <hi>Geneuiefue,</hi> and Saint <hi>Marcel.</hi>

The same commandement is made touching the casting vp of the sacrament by a priest, or a sicke person that shal haue cast his god out of his belly. At Beauvais in Beauvoisis, there is one of S. <hi>Christophers</hi> teeth, so great, that a dozen such teeth will fill the mouth of an ouen. At Rome, in Saint Iohn de Latrans Church, they keepe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skin of Iesus Christ. In the Church which is in the Parke of wood at Vincennes, they haue some of the powder of Saint <hi>Martins</hi> cloake, and one of Iesus Christs sucking teeth. At Courchiuerney neare to Bloys, they keepe <hi>Iosephs</hi> hemme at
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:11462:187"/> the sound of his breathing when he hewed timber. Our pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes from Galicia bring feathers of hennes that are of the race of that Cocke which crowed when Saint <hi>Peter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Iesus Christ. Cardinall <hi>Baronius,</hi> in the nine hundred and two and twentieth yeare of his Annales, maketh men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a locke of the haire of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> beard which did miracles:<note place="margin">Quantumli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet ipsi qui fu praeius se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem sedent eam impugnēt moribus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis.</note> And although (saith he) those that do sit in his Throne, seeke to ouerthrow it by euill manners. And these reliques are kept so many yeares, and neuer corrupt. They say, that the virgine <hi>Maries</hi> Milke hath continued sixeteene hundred yeares, and neuer was sowre.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time, we see the hosts which are called Iesus Christ, become mouldie in a few dayes, and the presence of Iesus Christ which is life it selfe, cannot keepe the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of this ridiculous corruption from moulding; by the which they will haue the roundnesse, the breadth, the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the softnesse, to mould and breede wormes; that is to say, that from Accidents they should turne into Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. But not long since some reliques are become cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. For <hi>Gregorie</hi> of Tours, at the end of his Historie, saith, That hauing visited the reliques in S. <hi>Martins</hi> church in Tours, he found them to be very rotten, but many years after they were all whole againe. The falshood of these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques appeareth not onely by the absurditie, but in this, that they are contradicted by the truth of ancient Histories, as also by our aduersaries themselues.</p>
                  <p>At Chartres they haue the virgine <hi>Maries</hi> smocke, which was brought from Constantinople into France by <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald, as they say that keepe it. And so saith <hi>Fauchet</hi> (from their reports) in his eleauenth booke of the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies of France, chap. 7. But <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald was neuer in Constantinople. And in the virgine <hi>Maries</hi> time they wore no smockes, which was the reason they vsed so many baths to wash the sweate from their bodies.</p>

                  <p>All men know, that in Saint Iohn Baptists time, there were no altars in Iudea, but those that were in the Temple in Ierusalem: yet the booke of Romish Indulgences printed in Rome, saith, that Saint <hi>Iohn de Latran</hi> was guardian of the altar whereon S.

To be short, euen as in the first Disputation, chap. 3. we haue said, that it is no sinne of Idolatrie, to worship a beame of the light vnder the which the diuell hides himselfe when any one thinketh it to be Christ: so when any one thinketh that that is a part or member of a Saint which is not, yet neuerthelesse he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth not the merite of his deuotion.</p>

                     <hi>George Cassander</hi> in his Consultation, in the chapter of the worshipping of reliques, after he hath said, that in times past, when the memorie of Martyrs was fresh, and their reliques certaine, miracles were done at their sepulchers, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse had crept in: That in the times of <hi>Basil, Ambrose,</hi> and <hi>Augustine,</hi> assemblies made in memorie of Martyrs, were changed into Faires, and into feasts, where the people are drunke: That to beguile the people, men haue suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed false reliques, and false miracles, and that oftentimes, by diabolicall illusions, superstitious persons haue beene abused: That trauellers, for profit and gaine haue made merchandise of false reliques: That the custome to lay the bodies of Saints vnder the altar, is changed, and that now they laid them vpon the altar. At last he addeth these words, saying,<note n="*" place="margin">Hodie vero cum passim o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mnia reliquijs sanctorum ple<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>na videntur, verendū est, ne si Episcopi &amp; Principes in veris reliquijs inquirendis &amp; diiudican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis eam quam debent operam adhiberent, ingentes &amp; detestandae imposturae patefierent, quem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admodum innonnullis locis factum est, vt olim B.

                  <p n="1">1 In the old Testament we see that the bodies of holie Patriarchs and Prophets were buried, and put in the sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of their fathers. <hi>Ioseph</hi> dying, ordained that his bones should be kept vntill the people went out of Aegypt, Genesis 50.25.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>Moses</hi> being dead, God would not let the Israelites know the place where he was buried, lest they should haue abused it to Idolatrie.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 In the 2. and 23. of Kings, King <hi>Iosias</hi> forbad the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to take vp the bodie of a dead Prophet out of the earth, and willed them to let it lie where it was buried. He made no transportation of his bones, nor did no worship, no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice, no offering nor adoration thereunto. The like is said in generall of all the bodies of the Saints, as of <hi>Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saac, Iacob, Samuel,</hi> and <hi>Dauid,</hi> whose bones haue not bene
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:11462:189"/> remoued, worshipped, nor separated one from the other, that diuers townes might haue their parts thereof. S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the 2.29. of Acts, witnesseth that then in his time <hi>Dauids</hi> sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher was to be seene, whose bones were not remoued from thence.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 In the 2. of King. 13.21 verse, God raised a dead man, by touching the dead body of the Prophet <hi>Elisaeus:</hi> God by that miracle authorising the authoritie of that Prophets doctrine. Yet for all that it is not found that his body was taken out of his graue, nor laid vpon an altar, nor that the people fell downe before his bones, nor that they offered vnto it, nor that they kissed his bones, nor carried them about in proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 If any man thinketh that the bodies of the Saints vnder the old Testament were polluted, or lesse holy then the bodies of the faithfull in this time, he is confuted by this example: for if euer any sepulcher of a Saint may be said to haue bene sanctified by God, it was that of <hi>Elisaeus,</hi> at the which God shewed forth so admirable vertue. Then the death of the iust was precious before God, as it is said, Psalme 116. And our aduersaries shew that they esteemed not the bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s of the Saints vnder the old Testament to be lesse holy then others, seeing that they haue some of them yet among their preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded relickes. And this euasion cannot serue but for the bones of the Patriarches and Prophets, but not for their apparell and moueables, which then were not kept in shrines, as at this day they keepe small rags and torne coates and shirts of the Apostles and other Saints.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 The Prophets, Esay 14. and Ieremie 22.19. among the threatnings and curses of God, make want of buriall one. Then how is that which God placeth among his curses, at this day turned into an honour? Why do men take the Saints bones out of the places where they rest? Why are they laid o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to the sight of men? Why are they separated and carried to diuers places?</p>
                  <p n="7">7 And to come to the new Testament, Acts 8. certaine men fearing God, layd the body of Saint <hi>Steuen</hi> which was
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:11462:190"/> stoned into the ground, but worshipped not his body, nor did not dismember it, to separate his bones into diuers places.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 In the 19 of Acts many were healed by touching the kercher and linnen clothes that came from Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> body: yet those linnen clothes were not put into a shrine, nor any worship done vnto them. These miracles were not done to cause them to adore those clothes, but to authorise the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Apostle.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 The Prophet Esay 8.19.20. after he had reproued diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and inchanters which went to the dead to aske counsell for men that liued, saith not vnto them, Why do you not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go to the relickes of Saints that are dead, but sends them to the Law and to the Testimony, if they would be illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the true light.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 And to be short touching this worshipping of Relicks, when our aduersaries are pressed to produce one onely place of the word of God for it, they are at a stay, and say nothing. And if they produce any thing, it is rather to mocke God, then to instruct men. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the fourth chapter of the booke of Relickes,<note place="margin">§ Ad tertium Scriptura ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probat cultum sepulcri &amp; fimbriae Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti: Item vm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae Petri, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dariorum &amp; semicintiorum Pauli.</note> falsly and against all truth, saith, that the holy Scripture approueth the worshipping or religious ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice done and vsed to the sepulcher of our Lord, to the skirts of his gowne, to the shadow of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> and to S. <hi>Pauls</hi> kercher. A wise man cannot affirme it, vnlesse he speakes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his owne conscience: for he knoweth, that in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture there is not one word spoken of religious seruice done to those things. And it is a wonder, seeing among the relickes which are worshipped he placeth Saint <hi>Peters</hi> shadow, that the Church of Rome doth not keepe some peeces of that shadow, as well of the blowing and breathing of <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same Cardinall in the beginning of the third chapter, falsly alleadgeth Esay 11.10, in these words, <hi>His sepulcher shall be glorious:</hi> but according to the Hebrew, it is, <hi>And his rest shall be glorious.</hi> A sepulcher may be honored without religious worship.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time, an indifferent Reader will consider
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:11462:190"/> what religion that may be, which hideth the writings of the Apostles from the people, and shews them their bones; which burieth their doctrine, and vnburieth their bones. As if a sonne should carefully keep old bootes, or a peece of his fathers skull, and hide away his Testament The best relickes of Saint <hi>Peters</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> are their writings diuinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired. That which onely should be cherished, and sought for, is the onely thing which is neglected: as the Iewes did, who beutified the sepulchers of the Prophets, and persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted those which followed their doctrine. Wherein marke their policie. For they seeke for, and worship the bones of the Apostles, in stead of seeking for their writings, because those bones speake nor, but their writings speake, and say things that are odious vnto the Papists: as also because in stead of those bones they can haue others; but they cannot make another holy Scripture. And because it is not so easie for them to trafficke with places in Scripture, as with peeces of relickes, whereof they onely sell the sight, and make a traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke of merchandise, and neuer deliuer it.</p>

                  <p>Experience confuteth this accusation. The Churches of France which presented this Confession to King <hi>Francis</hi> the second, haue liued and do liue peaceably and without confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion vnder this gouernment. This order because it is not a Monarchie is not therefore an Anarchie, seeing that each Pastor conducteth his flocke, and that the Pastors are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to a Synod, and the Synod is conducted by one Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator.</p>
                  <p>It is false that equality ouerthroweth the forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment established in Matth. 16. and Ioh 20. for in those places, there is nothing spoken of superiority or of subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. These are the ordinary falshoods of this Doctor.</p>
                  <p>Whereas he saith, that a visible head of the Church is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:11462:191"/> by these words, <hi>There shal be one sheepheard and one sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold,</hi> he doth it rather to mocke the Scripture, then to serue his turne therewith. This onely Pastor is not the Pope, but Iesus Christ. This sheepfold gathered together vnder one Pastor, is not the Church of Rome, but the Christian Church composed of Iewes and Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>And we must know that the equality of Pastors, touching the preaching of the word of God, &amp; the administratiō of the Sacraments, &amp; as concerning the vse of the keyes, is esteemed to be necessary among vs. For Baptisme, &amp; the holy Supper, &amp; the pronouncing of the remission of sins, are of equall dignity in the mouth of all Pastors, whether they be of great or small authority. But as touching Ecclesiasticall policie, we do not refuse to acknowledge those for pure and true Churches, where this equalitie is not obserued: because we esteeme not this order to be a point of faith, nor doctrine tending to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation. We liue (God be thanked) in brotherly concord with the neighbour Churches, which obserue another forme, and where Bishops haue some superiority.</p>
                  <p>I know that vnder pretence, that the Church of England hath an other forme of discipline then ours is, our aduersaries charge vs that our religion is diuers. But experience confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth this accusation; for we assemble with the English men in their Churches, we participate together in the holy Supper of our Lord: the doctrine of their Confession is wholly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able vnto ours. England hath bene a refuge for our persecuted Churches, who, notwithstanding the difference of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall policie, haue not receiued lesse entertainment. The excellentests seruants of God, in our Churches, as <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, Caluin, Zanchias,</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> haue often written letters full of respect and amitie to the Prelates of England.</p>
                  <p>He abuseth himselfe which beleeueth that the word <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> vsed in the holy Scripture, is odious in our Churches. And our aduersaries vniustly accuse vs to be enemies of the Episcopall order. For we must be altogether ignorant in Histories, if we do not know that all antiquitie speakes hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably of that degree. <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his Chronicle witnesseth that
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:11462:192"/> a yeare after our Sauiours death, <hi>Iames</hi> our Lords brother was established Bishop of Ierusalem, and that 10 yeares after, <hi>Euodius</hi> was created bishop of Antiochia; and that after <hi>Iames,</hi> succeeded <hi>Simon</hi> in the bishopricke of Ierusalem, from whence desended the succession of the Bishops of Ierusalem. Saint <hi>Hierome</hi> in his booke of Ecclesiasticall Writers, saith that <hi>Polycarpus</hi> (Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Apostles disciple) was by the same Apostle made Bishop of Smyrna. In the same booke he saith, that the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> established <hi>Timothy</hi> Bishop of Ephesus, and <hi>Titus</hi> Bishop of Candie. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the 32. chapter of the booke of Praescriptions, calleth those Churches Apostolicall Churches, and buds or sprigs of the Apostles, whose Bishops were established by the Apostles. Of this function and degree in the Church, were the Fathers, whose writings we haue, as <hi>Gregorie Nazianzen, Gregorie Nissen, Basil, Chrysostome, Cyprian, Augustine, Hilarie.</hi> &amp;c. Of whom whosoeuer doubteth that they had not some superio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and that to them particularly gouerment of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call causes did not appertaine, hath no knowledge of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</p>
                  <p>It is hard in all Antiquitie to finde three or foure examples of two Bishops in one towne; for generall custome was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it,<note place="margin">These exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are found in my booke of the Voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors, l. 1. c. 4.</note> which permitted not two Bishops to be together in one towne: as <hi>Theodoret, Chrysostome,</hi> and <hi>Hierome</hi> vpon the first chapter to the Philippians witnesse, and <hi>Augustine</hi> in his 110. Epistle.</p>
                  <p>But because we haue no expresse commandement for this superioritie in the new Testament, and for that, as experience hath shewed, it hath bene as a match to kindle pride, and hath degenerated into Papall tyranny; as also because the Church of Rome hath changed her bishopricke into a temporall Principalitie: &amp; hath made Episcopall dignitie subiect to the power of the Pope, to whom, for many yeares past, euery Bishop at his admission tooke an oath of obedience and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie; for these causes, the faithfull seruants of God, which haue trauelled and taken paines to abolish and to purge Papistry in France, in the Netherlands, and in Switzerland, haue sought
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:11462:192"/> to reduce the sacred Ministery into the Church, and to abolish the papal Hierarchie. But in England, where God hath vsed Bishops to striue against and to resist Papistry, &amp; where God hath giuen them soueraigne Princes, which maintained and vpheld them by their powers, Episcopall order continueth, flourisheth at this day. And God hath there raised vp and and still doth, excellent Bishops, both for learning and pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, which couragiously maintaine Gods cause, both by word of mouth and writing: and some of them also haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the crowne of martyrdome for the confession of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p>And euen as equalitie is receiued among vs, to shunne ambition and tyrannie, so England hath reiected this equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, to auoyd confusion and contempt of the Ministerie. They say, and that with good reason, that no societie, no family, nor common-wealth, can prosper without some degrees of superioritie: and that it is so among the Angels, and in the gouernment of the vniuersall world. That God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablished degrees of superiority in his Church vnder the old Testament. They say, that to place a man of little capacitie, and newly receiued into the Ministerie, in like degree with an ancient Minister of the Church, whom God hath endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with more gifts, and which hath serued long time in the Ministerie with commendation, is a meanes to nourish pride in the yonger, and to dishonour those whom God hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and to induce confusion: as also that thereby, the Ministerie among vs is become contemptible. And that the superiority of the Bishops of England hath bene approued by the most worthy pastors of our Churches, namely <hi>Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> and <hi>Bucer,</hi> expresly called into England to helpe them in their reformation.</p>
                  <p>All these allegations tend to three ends: one is to shew, that notwithstanding the diuersitie of Ecclesiasticall policie, two particular Churches may liue in peace and concord, and vnder the band of one selfe same faith &amp; religion. The second is to shew, that if sometimes we speake against the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Bishops, we condemne not Episcopall order in it selfe,
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:11462:193"/> but speake onely of the corruption which the Church of Rome hath induced into the Bishopricke, making it a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall principalitie, depending vpon the Papall Throne. The third is to shew, that there shall neuer be any forme of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline which hath not some dangers euitable in it, and which hath not some discommodities. That therefore is the best which approcheth nearest to the simplicitie of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and the discipline of their times; and which in such sort shunneth ambition, that thereby order may be maintained, and the dignitie of the Ministerie no way contemned.</p>

                  <p>I confesse, that greatnesse and humilitie agree very well; he that hath attained to soueraigne greatnes, hath no other meanes to increase the same but by humilitie: for that his humilitie is so much the more commendable, because he hath more temptations to pride.

                     <p>Now, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> had no superioritie nor power of iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction ouer the other Apostles, neither was head of the vniuersall Church, the Scripture sheweth it so clearely, that he that denies it must striue against his owne eyes, and belie his owne sence and reason.</p>

Which by the way sheweth, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did not reside in Rome, for then the Iewes were banished frō thence, as Saint <hi>Luke</hi> witnesseth, Acts 18.2. And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> would not haue chosen a towne to reside in, and to preach to the Iewes, where there were no Iewes.</p>

                  <p>For the vnderstanding of this Article, you must consider, that it is the Churches of France which speake, and that by consequence, by restoring of the Church, we only vnderstand the reestablishment and reformation which God in our time hath brought to passe in France, and not what hath bene done in the vniuersall Church: therefore the aduersarie hath no reason to require prophecies of vs which promise so notable reformation. For the holy Scripture speaketh not of France, nor of any accidents that should happen therin. To be assured of a thing it is sufficient to see it, although we cannot shew that God foreshewed it. If we must beleeue nothing that hath happened in our age, vnlesse we can shew that God foreshewed it by prophecie, we must not beleeue that the Pope in our time hath deposed our kings, and moued the French men to rebellion. We must not beleeue the inspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the mother <hi>Terese,</hi> nor the miracles of Saint <hi>Iohn de
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:11462:197"/> la croix,</hi> nor the comming of the Iesuites. It is true that the Reuelation foresheweth the massacres and persecutions of the faithfull: and that the whore clothed in scarlet, sitting in the towne which hath seuen hils, shall make kings drunke: the Apostle also foresheweth, that the sonne of perdition shall call himselfe God, and shall boast of miracles: and that false Doctors shall come, which should teach abstinence from marriage and from meates. And the holy Spirit foresheweth vnto vs, that God will raise vp a few faithfull witnesses, which shall preach with great affliction, in spirituall Sodome, vntill such time as the beast shall kill them. But these predictions are not for the Churches of France onely, which in this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle speake of that which is particular vnto them.</p>
                  <p>Touching the vocation of faithfull Pastors, which God hath extraordinarily raised in our times to fight against Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistrie, the clearing of this matter dependeth vpon knowing what the vocation of the Pastors of the Church of Rome is. Wherein there are two sorts of vocations of Pastors, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the one is none, the other corrupted. The vocation of Popes, terming themselues heads of the vniuersall Church, and the vocation of Cardinals, are no vocations, as being humane constitutions contrary to the word of God. And the vocation of Bishops and Priests therein is corrupted. According to the word of God, their charge is to preach the word, to administer the sacraments, and to gouerne their flockes. But the Priests charge is changed into the office of a sacrificer of the body of Christ, and the charge of a Bishop, is the charge of a Prince of the Popes temporall monarchie, as appeareth by the oath which Bishops make at their admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which is inserted into the<note n="*" place="margin">The Reader may see this oath at the end of my booke of the Vocation of Pastors.</note> Romane Pontificall, wherein there is no mention made either of God or of his word, but it is an oath which a subiect maketh to his soueraigne, or a vassall to his feodarie Lord. Among this corruption, this good onely remaineth, that when the Bishop admitteth a Priest, he sheweth him his dutie, and the nature of his charge, saying,<note n="**" place="margin">Sacerdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem oportet benedicere, praesse, praedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>care, &amp; bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizare.</note> The Priest must blesse, he must gouerne, he must
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:11462:198"/> preach, and he must baptize. And a little after,<note n="***" place="margin">Sit do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrina vestra spiritualis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicina populo Dei. Sit odor vitae vestrae delectamentū Ecclesiae Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti vt praedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione atque exemplo aedifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetis domum Dei.</note> Let your doctrine be a spirituall medicine to the people of God, let the sauour of your life be a reioycing to Christs Church, that by preaching and good examples you may build vp the house of God.</p>
                  <p>The same obligatorie words to teach the pure doctrine of the Gospell, are spoken to the Bishop. Where the consecrator asketh the future Bishop, saying, We aske the, whether thou wilt employ thy wisedome. as much as thy capacity serueth thee, to the sence of the holy Scripture. And after that,<note n="*" place="margin">Vis ea quae ex diuinis scripturis in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligis plebem euiordinandus es, &amp; verbis docere &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplis? Volo.</note> Wilt thou both by words and examples teach the people ouer w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>om thou art established, that which thou vnderstandest out of the diuine Scriptures? Whereunto the future Bishop maketh answer, and saith, <hi>Volo,</hi> I will. Then laying downe the Bible before him, he saith vnto him,<note n="**" place="margin">Accipe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangelia, &amp; vade &amp; prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica populo ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi commisso.</note> Receiue the Gospell, and preach vnto the people committed to thy charge.</p>
                  <p>These are ancient things, remaining entire among hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible corruptions, to the end that they may serue to touch the consciences of those that should take that charge vpon them, and that that good which remaineth, may serue to correct or to condeme that which is euill. Now it so fell out in our fathers times, that certaine persons called to the charge and offices of Priests, Doctors, and Bishops, hauing by the word of God knowne and found out the abuse of the Papacie, sought to accomplish their oathes, and called to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance the nature of the charge wherin they were established, and in the fame seates began to change their speech, and to preach the truth. They made vse of that good which was left in that corrupted function; God intending in that reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to employ those which had the vsuall charges receiued in the Churches of their countries, to the end that they might be the better receiued and esteemed of by the people, and that their vocation might not be denied or controuerted. For if the Church of Rome hath no lawfull vocation, why doth she require that in another which she her selfe hath not? If she hath lawfull vocation, then those without question had the same vocation. And it is in this, all one as if in the Arian
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:11462:198"/> or Nestorian Churches, a Pastor hauing acknowledged his error, should take vpon him to confute Arianisme, and to preach the true faith; and that therefore the said heretickes should molest him and aske him saying, Where is thy voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and where are thy miracles to authorise thee? That is in effect as if they should say vnto him, Who gaue thee charge to keepe thy oath which thou madest at thy admission? And where is the vocation which authoriseth thee to be faithfull vnto God?</p>
                  <p>Hereupon they aske vs, whether those faithfull Pastors who in our fathers times put their helping hands to refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, had ordinarie or extraordinarie vocation. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is, that they had that vocation which was ordinarie, and vsuall in the Church in their countries. But because the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and the vocation of their Church was corrupted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that ordinary vocation, they had an extraordinary commission. For touching the ordinary and vsuall charge in the Church in their countries, they retained that which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was good that is, their duties to preach, and purely to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister the Sacraments. But they had this extraordinary, that God employed them to preach contrary to their intentions which ordained them, as being contrary to the intention of Iesus Christ the first author of that vocation. And this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary commission being well considered, is no other thing but the ancient ordinary charge. It is inuerate corruption which causeth their enterprise to seeme extraordinary, as health seemeth to be new, after along disease or sicknesse of body.</p>
                  <p>We must not thinke it strange, that a man hauing an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary vocation, should by God be employed in an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary worke. The holy Scripture furnisheth vs with many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples thereof. <hi>Ieremie, Ezechiel,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> were Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites and Priests, hauing ordinary charge in the Church; and neuerthelesse were by God employed in extraordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missions, and to that end were extraordinarily assisted by the Spirit of God. I say not, that their vocations were halfe ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and halfe extraordinary, but that they had their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:11462:199"/> vocation fully and wholly, and that besides the same, they were inspired with the holy Spirit for an extraordinary worke. Such were the faithfull seruants which God raised in our fathers times. But it is to be vnderstood, that the ordinary vocation of <hi>Ieremie, Ezechiel,</hi> and <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> was pure and entire, but their vocations were corrupted, which corruption by custome had gotten the force of a Law: but they leauing the abuse, and shaking off the yoke of the Popes tyrannie, which endeauored to subiect all ordinary vocation to it selfe, conuerted that corrupted vocation to the right vse thereof.</p>
                  <p>We must not thinke it more strange, that an idolatrous and corrupted Church should conferre a vocation, which should be sufficient to bind a man duly to performe the office of a Pastor: for all oathes made concerning things that are iust and holy, whereinto a man hath not intruded himselfe, ought inuiolably to be obserued. Now in hereticall and idolatrous Churches, Pastors are receiued and admitted vpon promise to teach the truth. Besides, euery hereticall Church hath the chaire of the first institution, and by the intention of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ordained to preach the purity of the Gospell. Therefore the Councell of Nice in the 8. Canon ordained that hereticall Clerkes that had any charge among the Catharists or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatians, vpon their conuersions to the catholike Church, should remaine in the same degree that they were in. Onely it ordained that they should be receiued againe by imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hands, which was not an ordinary imposition of hands, but a simple blessing;<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 13. v. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>,</note> whereof there are many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in the new Testament. The 69 Canon of the Code of the Affrican Councels, ordaineth that the Donatists Clerkes should be receiued into the clergie of the catholike Church, and remaine in their first dignitie. Which is the subiect of Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> Dialogue against the Luciferians, where he proueth, that as the Church receiueth those which had bene baptized by the Arians, so she ought to receiue those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops which conuerted from Arianisme, without taking their dignitie from them.</p>
                  <p>But hereby the Church of Rome hath no advantage of vs,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:11462:199"/> as if we drew our vocation from her. For therein we giue no more authority to the Church of Rome then to the Arian and Nestorian Churches, seeing that we say that the most cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Church of all others, and wherein there is no saluation, loseth not her power to conferre a vocation, which although it be corrupt, neuerthelesse it bindeth a man to do his dutie, specially when he is admitted vpon oath to teach the truth. The principall point is, that those reformers of Papacy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued that which was good in their bad ordinary vocation, not from the Prelates which had consecrated them after the Romish manner, but from Iesus Christ and the Apostles, from whō these callings were first deriued. Euen as when the water of a cleare spring comes to vs through an vncleane channel, then infection cometh onely from that channel, but the water comes from the spring &amp; first originall therof: which coming thicke and troubled vnto vs, our labour is commendable, if we seeke to make it runne cleare. It is one thing to haue a vocation by the meanes and ministery of the Church of Rome, and another thing to haue it from the Church of Rome, and from her authoritie. The authoritie of the calling comes from Iesus Christ and the Apostles, and not from pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted hands through the which it hath past. The obligation to keepe a mans oath, comes not from him to whom the oath is made, but from God to whom we sweare, who onely hath the power in his hands to punish periury. Therefore, if I promise a man to do two things, the one holy and iust, the other wicked and contrary to the word of God; that mans authority cannot binde me to offend God, by keeping that which I haue euilly and rashly promised. Promises made against God do not bind. A wicked oath is worse to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. Therefore all the oathes made by Priests and Bishops vnto the Pope, are voide and of no force; but the promise which they make to preach the truth of the word of God, bindeth them, and is inuiolable.</p>
                  <p>That which is said before being well-considered, is a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient answer to that which they aske vs, which is, What mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles the first reformers did, to authorise their extraordinary
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:11462:200"/> vocation. For this question ought not to be put to those which haue had the ordinary vocation vsed in the Church in their countries. Besides there were diuers Prophets extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily raised, whom we find not to haue done any miracles, as <hi>Osea, Michea, Malachy, &amp;c. An euill and an adulterous ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration seeketh a signe, Matth.</hi> 12.39. And if those reformers of Papistrie had done miracles, their enemies being resolute to contradict them, would presently haue said, that it was of them which Iesus Christ said, <hi>There shall arise false Prophets, shewing signes and wonders,</hi> Math. 24.24. Mark. 13.22.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, all the meanes that our aduersaries helpe themselues withall in this question is, a shift or a slight to hinder vs from examining their doctrine. They busie vs with disputing vpon formalities, to keepe vs from entring into the ground of the cause, with the same policy by the which the high Priests and Scribes asked Iesus Christ and his Apostles the reason of their vocation. They busie vs about callings, thereby to diuert vs from the examination of doctrine. It is necessary indeed that a Pastor intrude not himselfe, and that he be duly called: but it is not absolutely necessary for the good of the people, that they should exactly know the voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Pastors: they shall not be answerable for that at the day of iudgement, but they are to giue an account of the obedience which they haue yeelded to the pure word of God, though it were preached by an vsurper, whose vsurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be vnknone to the people. For there is no man so foolishly scrupulous, which had not rather be led into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise by a man without a calling, then to be drawne into hell by a man laden with titles, hauing an ordinary vocation.</p>
                  <p>But the iniustice of our aduersaries specially appeareth herein, that they will haue all vocation in the Church to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the Pope, which is one of the greatest abuses in the Church of Rome, and hath most need of reformation. By this reckoning we must haue our vocation from the Pope, to preach against the Pope. And we must be silent vntill such time as some good Pope sends some men expresly to preach against himselfe.</p>
                  <pb n="361" facs="tcp:11462:200"/>
                  <p>But that which was most necessarie for them to do, that is, to let the people see the originall of Ecclesiasticall functions, &amp; to shew them that Iesus Christ instituted sacrificers of his body, this is the thing which they neuer do, and which they will not once touch; and for feare lest the people should look clearly into it, they hide the holy Scripture from them, which onely gouerneth and directeth Ecclesiasticall vocations, and propoundeth the first institution thereof vnto vs.</p>

                  <p>To proue that in our time God raised certaine persons by an extraordinary manner, and that reformation was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie, our Confession produceth not any place of Scripture in the margent of this Article, because that by places of the Scripture, we proue the points of our beleefe, but not what happened in our time in France; which are points contained in moderne histories, and no Articles of faith. It ought not to seeme strange, if in the Confession of our Churches there are some points inserted which are no Articles of faith. For as the title of the Decalogue is, The ten commandements of God: And yet these words, <hi>I am a mightie God, iealous, visiting the iniquitie of the fathers, &amp;c.</hi> and these words, <hi>In sixe dayes God made heauen and earth,</hi> are not commandements, but reasons whereupon God groundeth his commandements.

                     <p>In all this discourse there is not one true word, not yet common sense. It is false, that we go about to put the Church of Rome from any possession. We come to helpe the Church of Rome, and she complaines that we would take her goods from her; she vnderstands aide to be iniury. For those that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne her, feare that the Gospell will diminish their riches and great wealth: and that is the possession for the which they dispute.</p>
                     <p>It is false also, that we euer confessed that Iesus Christ gaue himselfe for an inheritance to the Church of Rome, in that sence which our aduersary meaneth. By the Church of Rome, we vnderstand the Church of the citie of Rome, to the which Iesus Christ neuer gaue himselfe for an inheritance, in other sort, then to the Church of Corinth, Ephesus, or Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople. He made his couenant with those Churches, with threatnings to take it away, and to remoue their candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticke, in case of contempt or rebellion: a mischiefe which hath happened to the Church of Rome. Life and truth are
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:11462:201"/> riches whereof the Church of Rome neuer was proprietarie, although in the first age of the Church it was one of those Churches which professed the word of God. The riches thereof which from age to age haue increased therein, by peruerting of manners, haue peruerted doctrine. For it hath bene forced to wrest the doctrine to make it appliable to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to build an Empire, and to giue a particular Church the title and properties of the vniuersall Church. And if <hi>M. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noux</hi> will haue the Church of Rome to be seized in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity of truth and life, without erring or falling away, he ought to produce places out of the Scripture, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme this prerogatiue vnto her. For there is no Church in the world how wicked soeuer it be, which may not also brag and say of it selfe, that it cannot erre nor be ouerthrowne. So the Iewes, conspiring against <hi>Ieremie,</hi> said, <hi>The law shall not perish from the Priest, nor counsell from the wise, nor the word from the Prophet,</hi> Iere. 18.18. But God maketh them liers therein, saying, <hi>The law shall perish from the Priest, and counsell from the ancient</hi> Ezechiel, 7.26. So Babylon speaketh, sitting vpon se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen hils, and exerciseth a trafficke or merchandise of soules, Apoc. 18.7. <hi>I sit being a Queene, and am no widow, and shall see no mourning.</hi> Note this word <hi>sit,</hi> for that is the word which the Popes vse to denote their dominion. To conclude, to say I cannot erre, is the worst of all errors. That Church which saith I cannot fall by error, is already fallen by pride, and lieth, in saying she cannot lie. In saying, that she is the rule, she exempteth her selfe from all rule, and her fall is the lesse recouerable, because that being fallen, she still thinketh that she stands vpright. Neuerthelesse, to proue that the Church of Rome cannot erre, behold what places of Scripture our aduersary setteth downe.</p>

Touching miracles we haue before spoken at large, and in the Section following we will speake more. But where did he learne, that <hi>Moses</hi> was sent to <hi>Pharao</hi> to reforme him? To bring the Israelites out of Aeygpt, is that to reforme <hi>Pharao</hi> or the religion of Aeygpt?</p>

                     <p>Our Sauiour said, <hi>If I do not the workes of my Father, beleeue me not.</hi> Touching that, we haue already said, that as the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles done by <hi>Moses</hi> still serued to authorise the Law, euen after miracles ceassed in Israel: so miracles done by Christ, and by the Apostles still serue at this day to authorise the Gospell, although miracles haue ceassed. When king <hi>Iosias</hi> openly shewed the booke of the Law which had bene lost, 2. Kings 21. he did no miracle, because he propounded no new thing, but reestablished the ancient doctrine of the Law, sufficiently authorised by miracles at the publication thereof in Horeb. It belongs to them that teach new doctrine to do miracles. <hi>False Prophets shall rise vp, and do great signes and miracles,</hi> Matth. 24.24. <hi>The sonne of perdition shall shew signes and lying wonders.</hi> 2. Thess. 2.9. <hi>An euill and an adulterous genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion seeketh a signe.</hi> Matth. 12.39. To those that shall say vnto Iesus Christ, <hi>Haue not we in thy name cast out diuels,</hi> it shall be said, <hi>Depart from me, I neuer knew you,</hi> Matth. 7.23. These are places which seeme to haue bene written expresly of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries, whose miracles at this day are all reduced to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting out of diuels. For to restore sight to a man that was borne blind, or to raise a dead man to life againe, there is no speech of such matters, their art extendeth not so farre. To conclude, all this is grounded vpon a false supposition, that we haue no ordinary vocation. Those which besides their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary commission, haue ordinary vocation, need no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles to authorise it. Now this extraordinary commission is grounded vpon the necessity of reforming the Church of Rome, and vpon the euident corruption of ordinary voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <p>Touching obedience due to Magistrates, there is nothing spoken thereof in this Article, that is referred to the last Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of our Confession, where we shall see the contrary to that which <hi>M.

It is therefore a foule slander which our aduersarie imposeth vpon vs, to say, that we beleeue that we must not obey kings but by policie, and for order, and not for conscience sake. The Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 13.5. takes away all doubt thereof, when he saith, that <hi>We must be subiect vnto higher powers, not because of wrath onely, but also for conscience sake.</hi>

And hereafter in another place he calleth it a humane law. That is the opinion of the Doctors of the Church of Rome. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> maintaineth against <hi>Barkley,</hi> that the power of kings is not <hi>de iure diuino.</hi> That is the apoph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thegme of <hi>Binet</hi> the Iesuite, speaking to <hi>M.

As the same Cardinall saith, in the 16. chapter and first booke of Instruction of Priests.</p>
                  <p>And if the Pope excommunicateth any man vniustly (for they all confesse that he may iudge amisse, (because he may erre in action, and condemne him that is innocent, to be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable) yet Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 1. declareth, that the<note n="*" place="margin">Causa <hi>11.</hi> Quaest. <hi>3.</hi> Can.

                  <p>Our Kings and their Officers, and Courts of Parliament, are dealt withall in the like vniust manner, in the Bull <hi>de Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na Domini,</hi> which is a solemne excommunication which the

Vpon which day the Pope appeareth standing in a Porch of a gate, with two Peacockes tailes on each side of his eares or head, and there in the presence of the people being assembled about him in Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Pallace, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth a long excommunication; wherein expresly he nameth the Chancellors, Presidents and Counsellors of the Courts of Parliament, ordinarie Iudges, and extraordinarie Commissioners; as also Emperors, Kings, Dukes, &amp;c. which shall appeale from the Pope to any future Councell: or that lay or impose new taxes and tallages vpon their subiects without speciall permission from the Pope: or that take tithes of the Clergie: or that in any sort take knowledge of Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall causes. In which clauses of excommunication, our Kings, and their Officers, and Courts of Parliament, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled, who euery day crosse and contradict those pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions; and for recompence of so many good deedes which the Pope receiueth from them, are excommunicated by the Pope, and euery yeare sent to hell by the strongest and most solemne excommunication which is made in the Church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>Our Churches in this 33.

                  <p>This Sacrament is administred in this manner: A child is presented to the Bishop by a godfather if it be a boy, or by a godmother if it be a daughter. The Bishop sits downe, wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his hands, layeth them vpon his breast, and sayes certaine prayers, by the which he asketh or requireth the seuenfold spirit. Then he asketh the godfather the childs name, and dipping his right thombe in the sacred oyle, which is called Chrisme, which they bring in a bottle, whereon the Bishop breatheth to sanctifie it, speaketh to the oyle saying, <hi>Aue Chrisma,</hi> I salute thee Chrisme.</p>

                  </p>

<pb n="378" facs="tcp:11462:209"/> if it be a daughter. The action ended, they bind the childs forehead with a cloath, and vpon the band put certaine golden spangles in manner of a crosse, and so the whole action is ended.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the first chapter of the booke of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, maketh Confirmation worthier then Baptisme in three things, first, <hi>Ratione ministri,</hi> In considerarion of him which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministereth, which ought to be a Bishop, but Baptisme may be administred in the Church of Rome by a porter and by a woman. Secondly, <hi>Ratione subiecti,</hi> in consideration of the subiect, that is, of the part of the body, for Confirmation is done in the forehead. Which are two comparisons as wisely made, as if a Prince hauing giuen a peny for an almes, and a subiect hauing giuen 10 crownes, I should say, that that peny
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:11462:209"/> is of more worth then the ten crownes, because of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the giuer, and because the one laid the penny vpon the poore mans head, and the other put the ten crownes into his hand. Thirdly and lastly, he wil haue Confirmation to sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe Baptisme, <hi>Ratione virtutis,</hi> because of the vertue, which is the principall point. For in the beginning of the 11 chapter, he saith, that this Sacrament conferreth a grace, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the person acceptable, yea a greater grace thē that which is conferred by Baptisme, as touching this point, to fortify the soule against the assaults of the diuell. To that end the blow on the eare serueth. Which being so, I maruell▪ why Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ would be baptized, and did not thinke vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing of the Sacrament of Confirmation.</p>
                  <p>The 25. Article of our Confession, by receiuing none but Baptisme and the holy Supper for Sacraments in the Christian Church, silently reiecteth this Sacrament of Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as iniurious to Baptisme, seeing that the Church of Rome in the places aforesaid, is not content to make Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme inferiour in dignitie to Confirmation; but also accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Baptisme of imperfection, adding a Sacrament there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, without the which men are but halfe Christians, and which supplieth the want and imperfection of Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>But I will passe ouer all these trifles of ceremonies, which haue a shew of coniuration. Our aduersaries, to proue this Confirmation by the Scripture, say, that Iesus Christ the same day when he instituted the holy Supper, taught his Apostles to consecrate the Chrisme which they vse in Confirmation: which is some dreamers tale: whereupon neuerthelesse the custome in the Church of Rome to consecrate the oile on thursday before Easter day is grounded. This fable is found in a Decretall of<note n="*" place="margin">Ep. ad O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rientales.</note> Pope <hi>Fabian,</hi> which as well as others of the three first<note n="*" place="margin">Baron. tom. <hi>9.</hi> ad annum <hi>861.</hi> Sect. <hi>5. 6. 7.</hi> quas du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bias esse, non dubium est. Item illis ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentitijs &amp; recens inuentis non eget Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesia.</note> Ages, is acknowledged to be false by the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest among our Aduersaries. This is rather to mocke then to defend the cause, that they ground their Confirmation vpon this, that the holy Spirit descended vpon the Apostles in forme of fierie tongues. From whence they inferre, that a Bishop ought to annoint and strike a child to strengthen
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:11462:210"/> him in the faith. <hi>Tobias</hi> Dog might as well serue for a proofe thereof. But our Aduersaries mistake themselues. They haue no lesse reason to ground their Confirmation vpon Acts 8.16 and 19.6. of the same, where the Apostles laid hands vpon certaine persons that were already baptized, who by that laying on of hands receiued the holy Ghost. For is there any thing spoken of Chrisme or Vnction in those places? which is the essence of this pretended Sacrament (for in the very forme which they vse in Confirmation there is mention of these things, as also of the blow, and of the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and such inuentions. The Imposition of hands by the Apostles, was not to celebrate a Sacrament, to perfect or strengthen Baptisme, but to conferre miraculous and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie gifts, as it is said Acts 19.6, <hi>After Paul had laid his hand vpon them, the holy Ghost came on them, and they spake the tongues, and prophecied.</hi> The same appeares Acts 8. where <hi>Simon Magus</hi> offered money, perceiuing that by imposition of hands the Apostles gaue the holy Ghost; which he could not haue seene, if some visible and extraordinarie miracle had not bin shewed. Certainly he would haue giuen nothing for the confirmation of the Romish Church. Those extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie graces were sometimes conferred before Baptisme, as to <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his familie.<note place="margin">Acts 10.44.47.</note> Which makes <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his booke of extreame Vnction, cap. 2. to say, that Confirmation was giuen to <hi>Cornelius</hi> before Baptisme: a thing neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse forbidden in the Church of Rome.</p>
                  <p>Touching the word Sacrament, if any man will call this Imposition of hands by the Apostles, a Sacrament, we will not contest with him touching that, for it was a sacred signe of the graces of God, as the Serpent of brasse, and at this day the Rainebow are the like. But they are not Sacraments in that strict sence, in which the word Sacrament at this day is taken: that is, for a sacred signe of Iesus Christ, and of his graces, common to all beleeuers, and perpetuall in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church. Of such Sacraments we acknowledge but two, that is, Baptisme and the Lords Supper, because Iesus Christ ordained but these two. Saint <hi>Augustine,</hi> in his 118. Epistle

                  <p>Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> booke of Sacraments speaketh but of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and the Eucharist. When the Fathers call other cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies Sacraments, they take that word in another gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall signification, whereby they call the Gospel a Sacrament, and the Incarnation a Sacrament, and to be short, all other things wherein there is any sacred mysterie.</p>
                  <p>The ceremony of ancient Christians to impose hands with vnction, was not a Sacrament apart, but was done at the time of Baptisme, presently after Baptisme was done, if it were possible. For the manner was that the Catechumeni were baptized by troupes. And in the same place, after they were baptized, they receiued the vnction with imposition of hands by the Bishop, and were exhorted to perseuerance in faith. Which was no part of Baptisme, but a dependance and a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, nothing like to the Confirmation practised in the Church of Rome. The Supplement of <hi>Philastrius</hi> puts this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the errours of the Greekes, to wit, that they hold the Pope and all the Latin Churches for excommunicated, and that they conferred Confirmation presently after Baptisme.</p>
                  <p>The Church of England retaineth that which is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in this custome, where Confirmation is no other thing, but a profession which the child (hauing attained to the age of discretion) maketh to keepe the promise which his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers and godmothers made in his name when he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and answereth touching his faith &amp; instruction: which done, he receiueth the Imposition of hands, and the blessing of the Bishop: which ceremonie is not called nor held by them a Sacrament. Our Churches in stead of that, cause children to be presented at Catechizing, and to answer pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely touching their faith, before we admit them to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper: which is done with prayer, that it will please God to extend his blessing on them. Which customes being of their nature free touching exterior forme and order, the end
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:11462:211"/> thereof ought to be the welfare and instruction of those which are in that manner receiued, together with the edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Church.</p>

                  <p>The Church of Rome, to peruert the thing, hath corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the signification of the word; for Penitence in the church of Rome is taken for whippings, fastings, pilgrimages, and corporall and pecuniarie punishments. Of a vertue they haue made a punishment: and of a repentance of the heart, a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall exercise: according to the manner of false religions, which change vertues into outward shews, and into corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall exercises, whereof the Apostle 1.

In which Sentence of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation Iesus Christ himselfe is comprised, who, Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lypse 2.5. speaketh thus to the Church of Ephesus, saying, <hi>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first workes.</hi> In the Romish translation it is, <hi>Age poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam,</hi> do Penance.

                  <pb n="383" facs="tcp:11462:211"/>
                  <p>The difference betweene vs is not, whether Penance be necessarie to saluation, and whether we must confesse our sinnes, and turne vnto God by earnest repentance: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Penance is a Sacrament or a sacred signe, wherein a contrite sinner ought punctually to confesse his sinnes to his Curate, from him to receiue iudiciall absolution, vpon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to make satisfaction vnto God by corporall or pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie Penance, which whosoeuer doth not accomplish in this life, shall accomplish it in Purgatorie, from whence neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse the Pope drawes out mens soules by Pardons.</p>
                  <p>We say, that admit there were no euill at all in this, and that this kind of Penance were conformable to the word of God, yet it can in no wise be a Sacrament: Our reasons are these.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 All our aduersaries with vs acknowledge, that euery Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a sacred and a visible signe of an inuisible grace of God.<note place="margin">Can. Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium. Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum est inuisibilis gratiae visibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis forma.</note> The Romish Decretall in the second Distinction of Consecration, maketh this definition of a Sacrament, drawne out of Saint <hi>Augustine:</hi> A Sacrament is a forme or visible ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parence of an inuisible grace. And this sentence of S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> is receiued among our aduersaries, that The word ought to be added to the element to make it a Sacrament. That being granted, it is manifest that this Penance is no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for where is the element? where is the visible signe instituted by Christ? for they compose this Sacrament of foure peeces, which are, Contrition, Confession, Absolution, and Satisfaction. Contrition of the heart is no sensible nor visible signe. Confession also is no signe of the grace of God, but a declaration that we are vnworthy of his grace. Confession is not ordained to signifie the grace of God, but to aske it. Moreouer the sacred signes ought to be administred by the Pastor, but Confession is made by euery particular man. I say the same of corporall or pecuniary Satisfactions, which are accomplished by the sinner, and commonly in his house, by fastings or whippings, or abroad by pilgrimages: whereas sacred signes are administred in the Church, by the hands of the Pastor. Absolution also cannot be a sacred signe of the
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:11462:212"/> grace of God: seeing that if it be good and auaileable, it is the grace of God. Adde hereunto, that this absolution is not an element nor a visible signe of an inuisible grace, for the words are not seene. If they answer, that it is sufficient that significantly it is the grace of God 'I say, that by the same reason the preaching of the word of God is a Sacrament, for it is sensible and a signification of the grace of God. It is not sufficient that Sacraments should be sensible signes, they must be visible, as the definition aforesaid saith, which is drawne out of the ancient Fathers, and receiued by the Church of Rome. The word must be ioyned to the element, but here they will haue the word to be an element.</p>
                  <p>I confesse, that the imposition of the Priests hands is a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible signe, but it is no element but an action, as the distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bread in the Supper is not the element, but the bread sanctified. Moreouer this imposition of hands was not ordained by Iesus Christ, for he did not command that the Priest should lay his hands on a man to conferre Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall absolution. If these words, <hi>absoluo te, &amp;c.</hi> be a visible signe, or a sensible element, by the same reason these words in Baptisme, <hi>Baptizo te, &amp;c.</hi> should be a sensible signe, and an element, and not a word added to the element to make it a Sacrament. Certes in disputing with our aduersaries we are constrained to speake as it were to children, to beate into them the first principles of reason and common sense.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The proofes which follow are no lesse plaine and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uident. Our aduersaries make Contrition of the heart the first part of this Sacrament, which Contrition and griefe of heart is so necessary, that without it Penance is a kind of moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie, and meere hypocrisie. But thereby they wound and ouerthrow their imaginary Sacrament: for besides the absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity therein found, which is to make a vertue or disposition of the soule part of a Sacrament, as if one should make faith part of the holy Supper▪ there is a further matter, which is, that the Priest is vncertaine whether thereby he confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a Sacrament, because he cannot be assured of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition of the sinner, and knoweth not whether the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:11462:212"/> which the sinner maketh, to be sorry for offending God, be true or fained. And yet if that Contrition be not had, there is no repentance, and by consequence no Sacrament of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. Surely this must needs be a presumptiue Sacrament which a man must guesse at, and a Sacrament which depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the will and disposition of the sinner, who if he will, can make it no Sacrament.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Adde hereunto, that all Sacraments are ministred by the Pastor; but of this Sacrament three parts, (that is, Contrition, Confession, and Satisfaction) are done by euery particular man, who, if he be but halfe contrite, if he maketh but halfe a Confession, if he maketh but halfe Satisfaction, it is but halfe a Sacrament: which are extrauagant conceptions, and a strange kinde of an irregular Sacrament.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 But the grossest absurditie of all appeareth in this, that oftentimes the Priest enioynes a sinner to make satisfaction within diuers yeares: in the ancient penitentiall Canons, there are penances found of 10, and of 20 yeares. Then seeing that this satisfaction is a part of the Sacrament of Penance, we may say that a man is 20 yeares administring a Sacrament, as if a man should employ 7 or 8 yeares to baptize a child, or to confer extreme vnction. But this is worse: for there are satisfactions which are made by respits, or spaces of times, as when a sinner is condemned to fast three yeares together, three dayes in a weeke, that is a Sacrament which is celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by respites, and hath a thousand delayes. So full of inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is superstition, and our aduersaries so ingenious to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guise religion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 But to shew the roote of this euill, if Penance be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Christian Church, then Iesus Christ ordained it. The Councell of Trent in the 14. Session and first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, findeth the institution thereof in the 20. Chapter of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> where Iesus Christ blowing vpon the Apostles, said vnto them, <hi>Receiue the holy Ghost, whose sinnes soeuer ye remit, they are remitted vnto them, and whose sins soeuer ye retaine, they are retained.</hi> In these words of Iesus Christ, our aduersaries (which inferre <hi>quidlibet ex quolibet</hi>) finde Auricular Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:11462:213"/> and pecuniary and corporall Satisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Note that these words are spoken to the Apostles after the resurrection of our Lord. Whence it followeth, that repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance preached by the Prophets, was no Sacrament. And in the Gospell,<note place="margin">Matth. 3.</note> when S. <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> preached saying: <hi>Repent for the kingdome of God is at hand,</hi> that repentance was no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for then Iesus Christ was not risen againe. And which is more,<note place="margin">Vulgata poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temini.</note> when in Marke 1.15. Iesus Christ said, <hi>Repent, and beleeue the Gospell,</hi> that repentance was no Sacrament, for then the Lord was not yet risen againe. And after the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Iesus Christ, Acts 2.38, when Saint <hi>Peter</hi> exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Iewes (not then baptized) to repent, saying, <hi>Agite poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitentiam, Repent, or amend your liues,</hi> that repentance was no Sacrament:<note place="margin">Nec ante ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentum Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sti poenitentia erat Sacramē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, nec est post aduentum illius cuiquam ante Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</note> for the Councell of Trent in the same place saith, That Penance is no Sacrament before Baptisme. There is no other Penance found to be in the Scripture; and it is not to be found, that this word Penance is prooued to be a Sacrament, or an exterior signe of the grace of God, but is said to be an earnest conuersion and an amendment of life. With the which Penance if we content our selues, we cannot be blamed for not receiuing other Penance then that which the Prophets, <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> Iesus Christ, and the Apostles preached.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 And if we must haue a Sacrament of Penance, we haue Baptisme, whereof S. <hi>Marke</hi> speaketh thus in the first chapter, fourth verse, saying, <hi>Iohn preached the Baptisme of amendment of life, for remission of sinnes.</hi>

                  <p>Which hindereth not, but that after Baptisme we should seeke to amend our liues, and bring forth fruits worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.

                        <hi>Sess.</hi> 14. <hi>can.</hi> 7.</note>) the nature of sinne. Whereof if a man willingly omitteth any thing, the absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is voide, and the Confession without fruite. Besides, the silence of this secret Confession is so inuiolable, that when by a Confession a Priest shall haue vnderstanding of any enterprise to be made against a king, he may not disclose it. No more do we allow of the distinction which the Councel of Trent maketh,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sess.</hi> 14. <hi>can.</hi> 5.</note> which ordaineth that a man shall confesse all his mortall sinnes, but touching veniall sinnes, (that is, such as are pardonable,) it bindeth him not to confesse them. By this meanes a man shall confesse nothing, for mortall sinnes are pardonable to those that repent and amend their liues.</p>
                  <p>The fruite of this auricular Confession is, First that Priests and confessors make themselues fearefull to those whose ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities they know. Secondly hereby they know the secrets, infirmities, and purposes of Princes, whereof the Pope is presently aduertised. Thirdly, that in a rebellion of subiects against an excommunicated Prince, they perswade bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shedding and rebellion secretiy in the peoples eares, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the last troubles. Fourthly, that therby they know all the dishonest women in a towne, and know those with
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:11462:214"/> whom they may commit fornication or adulterie without difficultie. Fiftly, that thereby they take pleasure it asking immodest questions, and teach vices vnder pretence of soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding mens consciences, and make enquiry of married mens se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, whereof also they haue made rules.

There is none (to speake properly) but God, that can absolutely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giue sinnes. It belongs to the partie offended absolutly to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. It is in him to pardon sinnes, that can punish soules. It is is in him certainely to pardon, which knoweth the hearts, and the interiour repentance of sinners. Now there is none but God to whom these things are proper. In the pardon whereby a Priest pardoneth a sinner for an offence by him committed to God, there are two things to be considered, one, that there is no pardon if the sinner doth not earnestly repent, the other, that he himselfe which pardoneth hath need of pardon. Of these two points, the first is the cause that the Priests pardon is conditionall, because he knoweth not the heart, the other is a cause that the Priest should consider of himselfe, that he is rather a delinquent then a Iudge: and to teach him to feare, lest that after he hath pardoned others, he himselfe may not obtaine pardon. It is a thing certaine, that if a sinner seriously conuerting and beleeuing in Iesus Christ, canot obtaine absolution of his Pastor which is passionate, or badly informed of the truth: God will pardon him. On the contrary, if a Pastor that is indulgent, and winketh at vices, or that is deceiued by apparence of repentance, absolueth an hypocriticall sinner, and receiueth him into the communion of the faithfull, that hypocritall sinner remaineth bound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and shall be punished not withstanding.

                  <p>The Doctors of the Church of Rome teach, that vniust absolution is auaileable. Also in the Church of Rome a man is absolued by a Proctor. And there a sinner is absolued when he knoweth it not, yea and against his will, which is as much as to saue a sinner whether he will or not. I haue seene those that haue caused absolution of their sins to come from Rome by bils of Exchange. The same Doctors say, that an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke and an excommunicated person may giue absolution at the houre of death. <hi>Tolet</hi> saith it in his first booke of the Instruction of Priests, chap. 15. That is to say, that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated person may administer the Communion, and conferre those graces, which he himselfe hath not, and whereof (if he had them) God maketh him no distributer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Emanuel Sa</hi> the Iesuite, in the beginning of his Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rismes sheweth vs what words the priest vseth in giuing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution. Among other things the Priest saith to the sinner: The passion of our Lord Iesus Christ, and the merites of the most blessed Virgine <hi>Marie,</hi> and of all the Saints; and all the good which thou shalt do, and the euill which thou shalt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently endure, serue thee for remission of thy sinnes, and for increase of grace, and for reward of eternall life. But the Scripture saith, <hi>That the bloud of Iesus Christ cleanseth vs from all sinne,</hi> 1. <hi>Iohn.</hi> 1.7. And, <hi>That we are iustified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Iesus Christ, Rom.</hi> 3.24. And, <hi>That by him God freely pardoneth all our offences, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loss.</hi> 2.14. And, <hi>That there is no saluation in any other, Acts</hi> 4.12. Away then with merits, either of our owne, or borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed of others, and all trauels and humane perfections where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men pretend to merite pardon before God. For if in all these workes and labours there were nothing to be disliked, yet they are things which we are bound to do. For he which
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:11462:217"/> oweth an annuall rent, in paying that yeares rent cannot satisfie and discharge his old debts. Moreouer, to ioyne these things with the infinite merite of the Sonne of God, is, as if a man should tie a blacke coale to a bracelet or chaine of bright shining diamonds, and couple most vnequal things together.</p>
                  <p>To be short, in what place of the Scripture do they finde one word, to proue, that by our merites, or by the merites of other men, we should deserue pardon of God? That is a new Gospell, a rule of merchandise seruing for trafficke: and a doctrine drawne out of the vnwritten word. The more we stirre this matter, the more the abuse is discouered: it is like a common sincke. The taxe of the Apostolicall Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie rateth letters of absolution for euery particular sinne at a certaine price, without excepting parricide or incest. And alwayes sinnes committed against the Pope are rated at an higher price, then those sinnes that are directly committed against God. This trafficke extendeth it selfe euen vnto the dead.<note place="margin">Pro mortuo excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato pro quo parentes sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant litera absolutionis vaenit.

For, vnloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the sinner by Absolution, at the same instant againe they binde him by corporall punishment, which they impose vpon him. They pardon him, and in the meane time make him subiect to a punishment. They pardon the fault, and yet constraine him to suffer the punishment. Iesus Christ did not so: For in the 8. of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> pardoning the woman taken in adulterie, he onely said vnto her, <hi>Go, and sinne no more:</hi> without imposing any satisfactorie penance, either corporall or pecuniarie on her, after her absolution. All the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall censures which the ancient Church vsed, and thereby humbled the sinner, were made before Absolution and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation to the Church. By those exercises of Penitence, the sinner satisfied the Church, but not Gods Iustice, which Iesus Christ hath fully satisfied.</p>
                  <p>Yet this is not all, for our Aduersaries hauing imposed sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactorie punishments vpon a sinner, presently after they dispence with him for money, and change corporall into pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary punishments, as we haue shewed in the 38.

By this deuice the Prelates haue drawne the knowledge of Matrimoniall causes to themselues, because (as they say) it belongeth to the Church to iudge of Sacraments. It is not knowne what great
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:11462:219"/> profit they reape thereby, and how many persons come to Rome for matrimoniall causes. The same auarice which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad Marriage to Priests, thereby to preserue the goods of the Church, hath made Marriage a Sacrament, thereby to take the knowledge of matrimoniall causes from the Magistrate. Truth herein is so manifest, that vntruth finds no place wherein to hide it selfe. For our aduersaries say, that a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a sacred signe instituted by Iesus Christ, proper to the Christian Church, wherby iustifying grace is conferred to those which receiue it. But nothing of all this agreeth with Marriage.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Euery Sacrament of the Christian Church was instituted by Iesus Christ. But Marriage was not instituted by Iesus Christ: for Marriage was vsed in the world before Iesus Christ was borne. If they answer, and say, that Iesus Christ changed the nature, or the vse, or the signification of Marriage, and that he ordained that from thence forward Marriage should be a Sacrament, then they must produce that ordinance of Iesus Christ. Which they could neuer yet do: it is a thing drawne from the vnwritten word.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Sacraments are remedies against sinne, &amp; aides to our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities: Marriage therefore is no Sacrament, because it was ordained before sinne entred into the world, and then when there was no infirmity in man.</p>

Marriage therefore is no Sacrament of the Christian Church, because it is vsed among Pagans, whose marriages are lawfull, as the Apostle teacheth vs, 1. Cor. 7.13. For counselling a beleeuing wife not to leaue or forsake her husband that is an infidell, he presupposeth that their marriage is lawfull, although it was before the conuersion of the wife vnto the faith.<note n="*" place="margin">Dist. <hi>26.</hi> Can.

                  <p n="4">4 The Church of Rome in effect acknowledgeth that Marriage is no Sacrament, by this that Marriages are there permitted to be made by a Proctor. For the Sacraments are not administred by a Proctor. To baptize a man for another man, and after a man hath for himselfe bene participant of the holy Supper, to participate the same againe for another man, is as much as to make a play of Christian religion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 In all Sacraments the word must be ioyned with the element, that it may be a Sacrament: but here there is no ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for neither the words nor actions are elements.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 And when a Priest (not knowing it) hath maried two persons together, whereof one is defectiue and incapable of marriage by their rule, either he hath truly conferred a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, or he hath not conferred a Sacrament. If he hath not conferred a Sacrament, then marriage is a Sacrament which dependeth vpon the integrity of the body of those which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it: and an action which to a man that is entire and sound is a Sacrament, but to a man that is defectiue is no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. And so it shall fall out, that the Priest doth that which he thought not to do, and thinking to administer a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he administreth nothing. But if those persons haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued a Sacrament, what is it when the marriage within short time after is dissolued, by complaint made by one of the parties? That were an vndoing and defacing of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as if Baptisme should be frustrated, or the Lords Supper disanulled, being receiued by a man that is ill disposed.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Adde hereunto, that the Church of Rome holdeth, that Sacraments conferre iustifying grace, <hi>ex opere operato,</hi> that is to say, by bare action, without the necessary vertue and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of him that conferreth it, or the attention of him which receiueth it. Then let them shew me what this action pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely is in Marriage which conferreth iustifying grace. Is a men regenerated by solemnizatiō of Marriage in the Church? If it be so, how cometh it to passe, that a man then becometh
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:11462:220"/> more licentious in superfluity of apparell, bankets, dancing, &amp;c. Is that the iustifying grace which thereby is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred?</p>
                  <p n="8">8 If they will that Marriage since the institution made by Iesus Christ, doth conferre iustifying grace, then they must produce the promise made by the Sonne of God, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth this iustifying grace to those that are married. This puts our aduersaries to a non-plus, and they are faine to send vs to the vnwritten word.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 By the Apostles counsell, 1. Cor. 7.37. one that is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, and not tempted with euill desires, doth wisely not to marrie. Which should be false, if Marriage were a Sacrament conferring grace. For is it a commendable thing to abstaine from a Sacrament which conferreth grace and iustifieth?</p>
                  <p n="10">10 But why should the Marriage of Patriarkes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets be no Sacrament, and the Marriage of a vicious Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, which marrieth incontinently, and against the will of his parents, be a Sacrament? What more holy or more mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call things are there at this day in the marriages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, then were in the marriages of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles? For if Marriage be at this day called a Sacrament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is a figure of the vnion of the Church with Iesus Christ, it signified the same in the old Testament, where that spirituall vnion is oftentimes represented vnder the figure of Marriage: as we see in the 45. Psalme, the Canticle of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> the 16. of <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> and the first and second chapters of <hi>Osee.</hi> And if euer any Marriage was sacred and full of myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, it was the Marriage of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eue.</hi> For as God vsed the casting of <hi>Adam</hi> into a profound sleepe, in the meane time to forme a wife for him, so God vsed the sleepe of the death of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> to get him a wife, that is, the Church. Or if the Marriage of Christians be esteemed to be a Sacrament, because it is indissoluble, how doth the Church of Rome separate Marriages onely because the parties mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried did both together present a child at Baptisme, or at Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation? Adde hereunto, that the inseparability doth not make a thing to be a Sacrament. If that were so, faith and
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:11462:220"/> repentance should be Sacraments, because they are insepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. And it is not found that the Marriages of Christians are more indissoluble then the Marriage of <hi>Adam</hi> with <hi>Eua,</hi> or of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Sara.</hi> And when Iesus Christ, Matth. 19.8. abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished the liberty of diuorces vsed among the Iewes, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Whosoeuer puts away his wife, except it be in case of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, he draweth them backe to the first institution, and saith, <hi>In the beginning it was not so.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11 The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 4.11. calleth circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>The seale of the righteousnesse of faith,</hi> shewing thereby, that Sacraments serue not onely to signifie some graces of God, but also to ratifie the same vnto vs, and to confirme the promises of God in vs. If then they will haue Marriage to be a Sacrament, it must not onely be a figure of the vnion of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ with his Church, but also seale and confirme vnto vs some particular promise of God which is found in his word. But they say nothing to this, that is any thing likely.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 Sacraments are tyed together by a naturall bond, one hindereth not the vse of the other: but the Church of Rome hath forged two discordant Sacraments, whereof the one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peacheth the vse of the other, that is, the Sacrament of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, by the which a man being made a Priest, becometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable to receiue the Sacrament of Marriage, and then that Sacrament of Marriage becometh sacriledge and an abhomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation vnto him. There are Ecclesiasticall functions which differ one from another, as seruing the tables, and preaching of the word, Acts 6.2, because of humane infirmity, which cannot attend diuers things at once. But it shall neuer be found, that a thing which is holy and sacred to some men, is profane and abhominable to others, and that the same which is a Sacrament to one man, is sacriledge &amp; an abhomination to another.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 And to conclude, this error doth wrap and intangle it selfe so many wayes, that this pretended Sacrament, is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament which men must diuine and presume of: in such manner, that in the Church of Rome no man can assure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe

It is a doctrine generally receiued in the Church of Rome, that if he which baptizeth, or marrieth, or singeth Masse, hath not an intent to do that which the Church ordaineth, or hath not an intent to celebrate a Sacrament, Baptisme and Marriage solemnized by him are nothing, and neither Consecration nor Transsubstantiation is made. Now this intent must be diuined or presumed vpon. Wherein ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse there is matter and subiect enough to doubt of: for the Church of Rome is full of Priests, which acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and detest the abuses of the Church of Rome, &amp; which condemne their owne actions: without speaking of Atheists, whereof the world is full, who in their hearts laugh and mocke at all that which is done in the Church.</p>

                     </note>14 For these causes or the like, <hi>Durand</hi> is of opinion, that to speake properly, Marriage is not a Sacrament. And which is more, Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the 1. in his 90.

This Bishop saith, that Marriage hath bene a Sacrament of Christ and the Church, <hi>ab initio,</hi> from the beginning, and not onely since the coming of Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>To be short, if we should say nothing, the thing it selfe would speake: for Marriage hath bene made infamous and abhominable to Priests, for the preseruation of Ecclesiasticall goods, lest they should take vpon them to withdraw some part thereof from the Church for the benefit of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,<note place="margin">Vxor superstes &amp; filij per quos Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stica solet peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re substantia.</note> as Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> the 1. in the 28 Distinction, in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non <hi>De Syracusana,</hi> saith.

                  <p>Which appeareth by dispensations and other practises, whereby in this matter the Pope exalteth himselfe aboue God. For the counsell of Trent in the 24. Session pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth all those to be accursed which say, that the Church can not dispence with degrees of consanguinitie prohibited by the word of God in Leuiticus.

If it be prohibited by the word of God, why doth the Pope dispence with Princes for the same? Haue Princes priuiledges to offend God? This artificiall deuice also appeareth herein, that the Pope hath inuented degrees of imaginarie kinreds betweene godfathers and godmothers &amp; the infant, which may not marrie without dispensation, and a great priuiledge. He hath extended the prohibition of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage to the fourteenth degree of affinitie, but he dispenceth therewith and with the first degree of affinitie, alway paying for it. The taxe of the Romane Chancerie imprinted at Paris with priuiledge and approbation, in the 40 leafe hath these words. The penitenciary may dispence with the first degree of affinitie at the barre of conscience, and the bill is sold for 9 duckets and sixe grosse. That is, that the Pope may giue permission to a man to marrie the sister of the wife deceassed, against the expresse prohibtion thereof made Leuit. 18.16. and 20.21. <hi>Innocent</hi> the third did it, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth, in the 28 chapter of the booke of Marriage. The Almaine Doctor in the 12 chapter of the booke of spirituall and temporall power hath these words, saying,<note n="*" place="margin">Martinus quintus consilio maturo habito, dispensauit inter aliquos in secundo gradu consan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinitatis qui est lege diuina prohibitus.

                  <p>To make Marriage a Sacrament, our aduersaries produce Ephesians, 5.32. which in the vulgar translation is thus set downe, <hi>This Sacrament is great, but I say in Iesus Christ and the Church.</hi> But in Greeke it is thus, <hi>This is a great secret or a mysterie, but I speake concerning Christ, and concerning the Church.</hi> In this place the Apostle speaketh of the sacred vnion betweene Iesus Christ and his Church: which vnion he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth to corporall Marriage betweene the husband and the wife. His intent was not to exalt the mysterie of Marriage, but the vnion of the Church with Iesus Christ. This mysterie then whereof he speaketh, is the mysticall vnion betweene Iesus Christ and the Church, and not the vnion betweene the husband and the wife. For hauing said, <hi>This is a great mysterie,</hi> that we should not thinke that he speakes of the mysterie which is in Marriage,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Extreame Vnction is a Sacrament of the Church of Rome, wherein the Priest annointeth the eyes, eares, nose, mouth, hands and feete of the sicke person, with consecrated oyle, making the signe of the crosse with his thombe dipt in oyle, and beseecheth God to pardon the sicke person all the sins which he committed by those parts of his body. Then he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the sicke person againe, and annointeth his reines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in them is the seate of the sinne of lecherie. That done, he washeth his hands with Water and Salt, and casteth the water into the chimney.</p>
                  <p>All this is done after the reading of the Letanie, wherein fiftie Saints at the least are called vpon, with diuers prayers which craue health and remission of sinnes for the sicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
                  <p>This Sacrament is administred to none but to sicke per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, which are in danger of death. It is not permitted to be administred to those that go to be hanged, or which go to place a petard vnder a gate, or which enter into a dangerous combate, or which go a long voyage by Sea.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Catechesis Tridentina cap. de Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma vnctione.</note>The Catechisme of the Councell of Trent saith, that this Sacrament serueth to deface and blot out small and veniall sinnes: for touching mortall sinnes, penitentiall absolution hath defaced them before.

                  <p>To ground this pretended Sacrament they produce two places of the Scripture, the first is, Marke 6.13. where it is said, that the Apostles <hi>Cast out many diuels, and annointed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that were sicke with oyle, and healed them:</hi> The second is, Iames 5.14.15. where it is said, <hi>Is any sicke among you? let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray for him, and annoint him with oyle in the name of the Lord: And the prayer of

                  <p>In the exposition of these places, our Aduersaries are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into contrary opinions, and their contention is great. Some of them, as <hi>Thomas Waldensis, Alphonsus de Castro,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Alphons. de Castro libr. de Haeresib. verbo Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma vnctio.</note> and <hi>Maldonat</hi> in his Commentarie vpon Saint <hi>Marke,</hi> are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that in the sixt of Saint Marke there is nothing spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of extreame Vnction; and that both Saint <hi>Marke</hi> and Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speake of sacramentall Vnction.</p>
                  <p>Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> on the contrarie denieth that the Vnction spoken of in Saint <hi>Marke,</hi>

                     </note> is the same that is spoken of in Saint <hi>Iames,</hi> and is not of opinion that that whereof Saint <hi>Marke</hi> speaketh, is the Sacrament of extreame Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>Cardinall <hi>Caietan</hi> is of another opinion:<note place="margin">Nec ex ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, nec ex effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis verba haec loquuntur de sacramenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li vnctione extremae vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionis, sed magis de vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctione quam instituit Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus Iesus in Euangelio à discipulis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercendam in aegrotos.

                     </note> for he formally denieth that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh of sacramentall Vnction, and beleeueth not, that vpon that place extreame Vnction can be grounded, saying: These words of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> are not meant of sacramentall Vnction, neither if we consider the words, nor the effect thereof, but rather of the Vncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Lord Iesus ordained in the Gospell, to be vsed by his Disciples to the sicke. For the Text saith not, Is anie sicke to death? but absolutely, Is any sicke? and saith, that the effect of that vnction is the easing of the sicke person.</p>
                  <p>Among these mixtures of opinions, the Councell of Trent takes a new way, saying in the 14. Session, that in the sixt of saint <hi>Marke</hi> Iesus Christ insinuateth the Sacrament of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame Vnction. And the Catechisme of the Councell of Trent saith, that our Sauiour giueth a scantling, and a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or an entrance.

                  <p>All this difference and contention may be drawne to these two heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The first is, whether this ceremony of annointing the sicke ought to be perpetually in the Church.</p>

                     <hi>and the prayer of faith shall saue the sicke, and the Lord shall raise him vp.</hi> Whereby it appeareth, that while the gifts of healing, and the vertue of miraculous restoring of health, were in the Church, it was expedient to obserue that Vnction▪ as an exterior signe of the vertue of God wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto God gaue efficacie. But since that vertue ceassed, there is no more reason to obserue that ceremony, then if a blind man should still vse spectacles: or if one should vse to combe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe when all his haire is fallen off and gonc. Interior vertue ceassing, exterior obseruation ought to ceasse. God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe giueth vs an example thereof, in this, that he tooke the tree of life from <hi>Adam,</hi> when by sinne he fell into death. Not that life depended vpon that tree, but because God will not haue vnprofitable signes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 From hence it appeareth▪ that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh not of extreme Vnction, seeing he speaketh of an Vnction whereby a man is restored to health. The Vnction is extreme which is giuen in extremitie, but this vnction is giuen to those which are to liue still, and that being restored to health might in the same necessitie vfe the same remedy againe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Adde hereunto, that Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh not of oyle consecrated by a Bishop, nor of oyle kept in the Church; for the Apostles (in that healing) vsed such oyle indifferently as was at hand; neither doth he speake of that heape of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies at this day vsed in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="407" facs="tcp:11462:225"/> haue receiued the Sacraments of the Eucharist and of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and which are not by iustice condemned to die.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The commandement therefore of saint <hi>Iames</hi> ought yet at this day to be practised, touching the prayer of faith made by Priests or Ministers, to the which remission of sinnes is promised, but not touching corporall annointing, which was vsed for healing.

Words which testifie, that the principall end of this vnction, was the healing of the body.<note n="*" place="margin">Deus qui fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulo tuo Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiae ter qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos annos ad vitā donasti, ita &amp; hunc famulum tuū à lecto aegri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinis erigat ad salutem.

                  <p>That which Saint <hi>Iames</hi> addeth, is nothing repugnant thereunto, when he saith, <hi>If he hath committed sinnes, they shall be forgiuen him.</hi> For those words are as much in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="408" facs="tcp:11462:226"/> if he had said, that health shall be restored vnto him, those sinnes for the which God had afflicted him, being pardoned. Iesus Christ himselfe teacheth vs that, Matth. 9.5. where he saith, that to say vnto a sicke person, <hi>Thy sinnes are forgiuen thee,</hi> and to say, <hi>Take vp thy bed and walke,</hi> are all one in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For, the cause of the euill being taken away, by neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity the euill ceasseth. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> therefore in that place followeth the words of his Maister. Besides, he attributeth not this remission of sinnes to the vertue of the oyle, but to prayer made in faith, saying, <hi>The prayer of faith shall saue the sicke, and the Lord shall raise him vp; if he hath committed sins, they shall be forgiuen him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6 Thereupon our aduersaries aske vs, why S. <hi>Iames</hi> in that place speaketh of sicke persons, and not of deafe and blind men. But this is not to dispute against vs, but to demand of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> a reason of his speech. It may be that the Apostle by one kind of corporall infirmity, did also vnderstand others: and it may also be, that Vnction was vsed to none but to those that lay sicke in their beds, and that they vsed not that kind of remedy for deafe, blind and impotent persons, as we may see of the lame person spoken of, Acts 3.2.</p>
                  <p>It is to no purpose to obiect, that many also besides Priests had the gift of healing; and that therefore it was not need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to call them to performe this annointing to heale the sicke. For then God more commonly conferred those gifts vpon Pastors, and in a greater measure then vpon others, to authorize their preaching.</p>
                  <p>It is also to no purpose to say, that if as often as Priests an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed the sicke they were healed, no man would haue died in those times: for many had no desire to call them, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny had not the meanes nor the leisure. And Saint <hi>Iames</hi> did not promise that they should heale all without exception. For in the ninth of Saint Marke, the Apostles could not heale a man possest with a diuell. And it is not vnlikely, that when God reuealed to an Apostle, that the time of the sicke parties death approched, the same Apostle abstained from vsing of that remedie which he knew would not preuaile.</p>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:11462:226"/>
                  <p>Now for the second point,<note place="margin">The second point, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extreme Vnction be a Sacrament.</note> which is to know whether the Vnction which the Apostles and their Disciples vsed, may be called a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Touching that I say, If we take the word Sacrament in the same sence which the ancient Fathers and Romish Bible or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily take it, that is, for a mysterie, or for a sacred signe, nothing hindereth but that we may call this Vnction a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, seeing it was a sacred signe of the grace and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of God.</p>
                  <p>But this Vnction cannot be called a Sacrament, in the same sence that Baptisme and the Lords Supper are called Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that is, sacred signes and seales of the Couenant made by God in Iesus Christ, instituted by Iesus Christ himselfe; I say that in this sence, the Vnction whereof Saint <hi>Iames</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth cannot be called a Sacrament.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For Sacraments taken in this sence, are instituted for the health of the soule, but that Vnction specially and principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly serued for the health of the body.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Not onely the practise of Sacraments (as of Baptisme and of the Lords Supper) but also the institution of them by Iesus Christ are found in the Gospell. But none of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists do recite the institution of this Sacrament, neither where, when, nor how Iesus Christ did institute it. Onely we see a practise of this Vnction by healing of the sicke, which of a miraculous medicine is changed into an ordinary Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, laden with a thousand ceremonies after the custome and manner of superstition, which is to multiply ceremonies after the vertue is lost. I do not deny that this Vnction was commanded by Iesus Christ: for it is not credible that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles did any thing without his commandement. But euery thing which Iesus Christ commanded his Apostles to do, is not a Sacrament. He commanded his Apostles to do many things which were personall to themselues, and which ought not to be perpetuall: as when he commanded them to go and preach the Gospell, without money, and without prouision for themselues. And if this Vnction were a perpetuall Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Euangelists would carefully haue recited the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:11462:227"/> and the commandement thereof to be perpetually obserued in the Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The Sacraments of the Christian Church ought to be administred in the Church: but this extreme Vnction is neuer administred but in particular mens houses.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The fruit &amp; vse of this extreme Vnction witnesseth that it is no Sacrament. For the Councell of Trent in the 7. Session, in the 6. and 7 Canon, saith, That Sacraments containe the grace which they conferre, and that they conferre the same to those which duly receiue them. Therefore the sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall words of other Sacraments are conceiued at the present time when they are conferred, as in Confirmation, <hi>Signo te sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no crucis, &amp; confirmo te Chrismate salutis,</hi> I marke thee with the signe of the crosse, and confirme thee with the chrysme of saluation. And in Baptisme, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, &amp;c. and so in all the rest. There is none but this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament onely, which doth not conferre grace, but onely maketh a request: which saith not, <hi>I heale thee, or I absolue thee,</hi> but onely asketh health and remission of sinnes. Then if it be a Sacrament, it must be an optatiue Sacrament, and not a Sacrament conferring the grace of God, an irregular Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which by his signes doth not represent graces but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. For our aduersaries might perceiue, that if they had said, <hi>I heale thee,</hi> they had bene confuted by experience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause very few sicke persons escaped death after extreme Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, which was carried to none but to those that were at the point of death, as if that Sacrament serued onely to end life, and not to prolong it. They might also consider, that if they said, <hi>I forgiue thee thy sins,</hi> this Sacrament should vsurpe vpon the Sacrament of Penance.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 In the meane time by this manner of optatiue speaking, they imprint a scruple in mens minds: for seeing that of two things which the Priest requireth of God, that is, healing of the sicke person, and remission of sins, it appeareth that God doth not heare him in the one: how then shall we be assured that God heareth him in the other? seeing that the place of Saint <hi>Iames</hi> whereon they partly ground this Sacrament, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:11462:227"/> promiseth health and remission of sinnes?</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>9</label> The conferring of sacred Orders in the Romish Church is called a Sacrament. Those orders are 7. viz. Porters, Readers, Exorcists or Coniurers, Acolyths or such as minister to the Priest at Masse, Subdeacons, Deacons, and Priests, vnder the which Bishops are contained. For the Church of Rome doth not make two orders of Priests and Bishops.</p>
                  <p>Our aduersaries do not say that Iesus Christ did institute these seuen Orders aforesaid: and no Sacrament is of force which was not instituted by Iesus Christ. But they say, that Iesus Christ did execute and exercise those seuen Orders, and supplied those functions. They say that he did the office of a porter, when he said, <hi>I am that doore of the sheepe,</hi> Ioh. 10.7. That he did the office of a Reader, when he tooke the booke of the prophesie of Esay, and read it in the Synagogue, Luk. 4.16.17. That he did the office of an Exorcist, when he draue out wicked spirits. Pope <hi>Inocennt</hi> 3. in the first booke of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the Masse, cap. 3. saith, that Iesus Christ did the office of an Acolyth (or a seruer of the Priest at Masse,) when he said <hi>(I am the light of the world:)</hi> for that office was to beare waxe candels. And in the fourth chap. he saith, that Iesus Christ did the office of a Subdeacon, when he washed his disciples feet, and in the fift chapter he saith, that Iesus Christ did the office of a Deacon, when he distributed the Sacrament, and when he waked the disciples when they slept, Luk. 22.45.46 Lastly all of them say, that Iesus Christ did the office of a Priest, when he sacrificed his body in the Eucharist, vnder the signe of bread. But which of these seuen offices did he, when he preached the Gospell? That is a point wherewith those sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Doctors do not trouble themselues: and in truth it is not a necessarie thing, for a man may be a Priest among them without being a preacher. There rested nothing but to make Iesus Christ an Abbot, or a Cardinal, or a Pope; for the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:11462:228"/> would haue furnished these Doctors with places which they might wrest to their purpose with the like dexteritie.</p>
                  <p>Euery one of these orders are conferred by words and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies cleane differing one from the other. Whereupon it followeth, that each Order is a Sacrament apart, and that it is an abuse by them committed to reckon but seuen Sacraments in the Church of Rome, when there are thirteene.</p>
                  <p>To examine each of these Orders, were as much as to picke strawes, and to shew diligence where there is no need. The Order of Priests only deserueth and requireth some discourse, for that vpon the puritie and lawfull exercise of Priesthood, the integritie of all other Orders, and the puritie of all religion dependeth.</p>

This imposition of hands was vsed in the old Testament, as you may see Numbers 27. and 34. of Deut. where by Gods commandement <hi>Moses</hi> laid his hand vpon <hi>Iosua</hi> to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish him in his office.

                  </p>
                  <p>The question betweene vs is, whether this Order may be called a Sacrament. I answer, that if the word Sacrament be taken simply for a sacred signe or for a mysterie, which is the sence wherein this word is ordinarily taken among the Latine Fathers, and in the translation of the Romish Church, we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>asiely admit this imposition of hands to be called a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, because it is a visible signe of an inuisible grace, v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Apostles.</p>
                  <pb n="414" facs="tcp:11462:229"/>
                  <p>But to be called a Sacrament, in the same sence that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme and the holy Supper are called, there are many things that hinder. For this imposition of hands, is not a sacred signe of the couenant of God in Iesus Christ, and is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all the faithfull: neither is the expresse Institution thereof, found in the histo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ie of the Gospell. For Iesus Christ did not establish his Apostles in their offices by laying his hands on them, but by breathing on them, and saying vnto them, <hi>Receiue the holy Ghost, whose sinnes soeuer you remit, they shall be remitted, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church of Rome hath a particular reason not to place sacred Orders among the Sacraments: for by prohibiting Marriage to Priests, and calling a Priests Marriage sacriledge, it maketh the Sacraments fight together, and causeth one to exclude the other, and to become sacriledge.</p>
                  <p>But this disputation, whether the ordaining of Priests may be called a Sacrament, is not the principall difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs; and we could be content to call it a Sacrament, so Priesthood did not change nature, and that the functions thereof were ruled and limited by the word of God. But the corruption therein is so great, that Priesthood at this day is not the ministery of the Gospell. For of Preachers of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and Ministers of the Sacraments, Priests are become sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificers of the body of Christ, which they maintaine to be a reall and propitiatory sacrifice. Their office is to make Iesus Christ with words, to sacrifice him to his Father. By the same corruption the bishopricke among them is become an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly principality, and a dignity of a Prince of the Popes Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie.

                  <p>By these words the Bishop conferreth a charge which Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ did not institute, yea and such a charge as surpasseth all the dignity and power of Angels, whose vertue and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency is nothing in regard of making Iesus Christ, and of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering him to God for a sacrifice: which deserued a formall commandement and an expresse institution of Iesus Christ. But there is no such thing found in the Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For the Apostle, Ephesians 4.11. and 1.

                  <p n="3">3 And it is not without cause, that oftentimes in the new Testament all the faithfull are called Priests: but there is no place in the Scripture to be found where Pastors of the Church are expresly called sacrificers.

                  <p n="4">4 For, not to speake of the iniurie done to the sacrifice of
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:11462:230"/> the crosse, whereof I will speake hereafter: I say, that by this office of a sacrificer of the body of Iesus Christ, the Priest exalteth himselfe aboue Iesus Christ. For it is manifest, that to sacrifice, is a more excellent thing, then to be sacrificed: as <hi>Aaron</hi> was more excellent then his offerings, or the things that he offered; for <hi>Aaron</hi> represented Iesus Christ sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, as the thing offered represented Iesus Christ which was to be offered. The dignity of the sacrificing priest makes the offering acceptable. The Priest therefore sacrificing Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, exalteth himselfe aboue Iesus Christ, because the Priest is the Sacrificer, and Iesus Christ is the Sacrifice. For although y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> in the Masse they pretend that Iesus Christ is also the sacrificer, yet this is certaine, that the Priest sacrificing Iesus Christ in the Masse, is more excellent then Iesus Christ, in as much as he is there sacrificed. For when we shall haue examined and considered all the actions whereby the Priest pretendeth to accomplish his sacrifice, as the pronunciation of the consecrating words, the eleuation of the Host, the prayers which beseech God to accept of that offering the breaking; and the eating, we shall finde that the Priest doth all these things, and that they cannot be attributed to Iesus Christ. From whence it followeth, that in the sacrifice of the Masse, Iesus Christ is not sacrificed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 It also appeareth that in the Masse the Priest exalteth himselfe aboue Iesus Chrlst, in this, that he holdeth the Host in his hands, he breaketh it when he will, he carrieth it whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he will, and when it pleaseth him he may throw it into the fire, or treade it vnder his feete. For that Iesus Christ which he pretendeth to sacrifice, is without sense and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and cannot defend himselfe. He cannot breathe, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his eyes, nor stirre his hands. And although the Priest were a murtherer, an incestuous person, or a Sodomite, yet (according to the opinion of the Romish Church,) he hath Iesus Christ in his power.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 If we aske our Aduersaries, wherein the sacrifice of the new Testament, and that perpetuall office of sacrificing according to the order of <hi>Melchizedech</hi> consisteth: they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer,
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:11462:230"/> that it consisteth herein, That euery day the Priest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificeth the body of our Lord, vnder the accidents of bread and wine in the Eucharist. How then comes it to passe, that the Epistle to the Hebrews, which is one of the longest, and which (in a manner) speaketh of no other thing then of the sacrifice of the new Testament, and of the Priesthood after the order of <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> speaketh nothing of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, nor of the sacrifice of bread and wine, nor of any earthly sacrifice? but speaketh of no other sacrificer then Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, nor of any other Sacrifice then of his death? How did he forget that wherein at this day they make the Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the Christian Church onely to consist? The Apostle by this reckoning, doth like one that writing of the dutie of a King, speaketh neither of his kingdome, nor of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects: or, as if one should write of the art of Horsemanship, without speaking of horses. For the Apostle hath at large written of the continual office of the Sacrificing in the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Church, without speaking of the sacrifice of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist, wherein they will haue this office of Sacrifice onely to consist.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Further, if we aske our aduersaries, when this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the order of Priesthood was instituted, they answer, that Iesus Christ did institute it when he celebrated the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist among his Apostles, and say, that then they receiued the order of Priesthood. But in that action, where was there any conferring of that Order? Where was the imposition of hands? or any other ceremony which supplied that want? Where was there any instructions touching the office of Priests? seeing that priesthood (according to themselues) hath many other functions, besides sacrificing of the body of our Lord?</p>
                  <p n="8">8 But who will beleeue, that Iesus Christ celebrating the holy Supper, did institute two Sacraments by one acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Two different or seuerall Sacraments should necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily be instituted by different words or seuerall ceremonies. We cannot by like words and actions administer Baptisme and Marriage; or conferre Confirmation, &amp; extreme Vnction.</p>

                  <p n="9">9 If the Apostles were made Sacrificers when Iesus Christ said vnto them; <hi>Do this in remembrance of me:</hi> it followeth, that they might sing Masse (as at this day they say) while Iesus Christ was vpon the Crosse, or in the Sepulcher; which necessa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="10">10 From hence also it would follow, that the Apostles were for a while Priests without keyes, and could sing Masse without giuing absolution: for the power to remit sinnes promised vnto them in the 18. of Saint Matthew, was not actually conferred vnto them, but in Iohn 20.23, certaine dayes after the resurrection of the Lord.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 Let the Reader that hath any care of his saluation, earnestly consider that which I shall say: which is, that Saint Matthew and S. Marke, reciting how, and in what manner Iesus Christ instituted &amp; celebrated the Eucharist among his Disciples, haue set downe these words, <hi>Do this,</hi> and adde no more. Then if by these words, <hi>Do this,</hi> the Lord did e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish Sacrificers of his body, and instituted the sacrificing Priesthood of the new Testament, as the Councell of Trent saith: and if by those words Iesus Christ instituted a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we must say, that those two Pen-men of the holy Ghost, whereof the one, that is, Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> was present at the action, haue made a rehearsall vnto vs of this institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is defectiue in the principall point, and haue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the institution of this Sacrifice so important, and of this office of Sacrificer of the new Testament. If they had done as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> doth, who speaketh not at all of the Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Supper, it might be thought to be lesse strange that S. <hi>Matthew</hi> and S. <hi>Marke</hi> had omitted both the institution of the holy Supper, and of the office of Sacrificer. But reciting the institution of the holy Supper; and omitting those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall words, whereby they say he instituted an office of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer and a Sacrifice, it is manifest and most euident, that they were ignorant of that office of Sacrificer, and of that i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginarie
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:11462:231"/> sacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 I would likewise haue them shew me, who conferred the office of Sacrificer to Saint <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle, and who gaue him authoritie to sacrifice the body of Iesus Christ: for he was not at the Table with the Apostles, when the Lord said vnto them, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi> In the Acts of the Apostles we see, how Iesus Christ called him, and how he established him in his office of Apostle, in which office he saith, he was not established by any man, but by Iesus Christ. And the office whereunto Iesus Christ called him, was not to be a Sacrificer of his bodie, <hi>but to be an instrument, to beare his name before the Gentiles, and Kings, and the children of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> Acts 9.15. Behold here then an Apostle without the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Sacrificer, to whom Iesus Christ neuer said, Sacrifice me in remembrance of me.</p>
                  <p n="13">13 And seeing that our Aduersaries are of opinion that Iesus Christ celebrated Masse in Emaus with two of his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, whereof we reade in Luke 24. I aske then, If in that action he made those two Disciples Sacrificers of his bodie? If, saying vnto them, <hi>Do this,</hi> he did not make them Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; it followeth, that these words, <hi>Do this,</hi> do not sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie, <hi>Sacrifice me.</hi> But if by these words he made them Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificers, it will follow that there were Sacrificers which had not their vocation from Saint <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="14">14 The Apostle S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 11.14. rehearseth the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this holy Sacrament, that the Corinthians might be confirmed therein. There he witnesseth that Iesus Christ saying, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> spake to all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: for those to whom he directed those words, are they (who in the verse ensuing) he commandeth to declare the death of the Lord, and to eate of that Bread, and drinke of that Cup after they haue examined themselues: which is a commandement made to the people, and which euery faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Christian ought to do. By this meanes euery Christian shall be a Sacrificer, and may sing Masse.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 If these words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> were words that ordained the office of Sacrificers, euery time, &amp; as often
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:11462:232"/> as we should exhort the faithfull in that holy action, to do that in remembrance of Iesus Christ which Iesus Christ did, we should establish as many sacrificers as there are commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants.</p>
                  <p n="16">16 The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the Hebrewes speaketh ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely against this inuented office of sacrifice; for besides that which he saith in the 5. Chapter 4. verse, that <hi>No man ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this honour vnto himselfe, but he that is called of God, as Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron was,</hi> in the chapter 7.23.27. he giueth two peremptory reasons, for the which the sacrifice and the office of sacrificing ought to be abolished. The one, that the soueraigne sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the Law were subiect to die, and that death hindred them from continuing. The other is, that they were bound to sacrifice first for their owne sinnes, and after for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples sinnes: which also concerned inferior sacrificers, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so being mortall and sinners, died and were taken away. What is in all this that equally concernes not the sacrifices of the Church of Rome, who are likewise mortall and sinfull? And what cause may be giuen, why the Priests should continue and be suffered in the Church, which may not as well be for the continuance and maintenance of the Priests of the Law? Was the Apostle so voide of sence, as not to see and perceiue that speaking in that manner against the office of the legall sacrifice, he also spake against the office of sacrificing vnder the Gospell? Would he not (thinke you) haue taken away this scruple, and preuented this obiection?</p>
                  <p n="17">17 To be short, the Bishops of the Church of Rome are continuing there still, and yet could neuer shew their power, nor their commission from Iesus Christ to establish sacrificers of his body in the Church.</p>

                  <p>The ordinary exposition which they make of these words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me, is,</hi> Sacrifice my body and my bloud, really vnder the kinds of bread and wine, as a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatorie sacrifice for the liuing and the dead. To expound the Scripture in this manner, is not so much to wrest it, as to play therewith. These Doctors contrary to all apparence of truth, will haue that to be Iesus Christs meaning, which the words of our Lord can by no meanes beare.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For we cannot sacrifice Iesus Christ, in remembrance of Iesus Christ. The memories of things are of other nature then the things themselues: as mens pictures are not the persons themselues.<note place="margin">Bellar. l. <hi>2.</hi> de Euchar. c. <hi>24.</hi> Idem Christus fuit figura sui ipsius.

                  <p n="2">2 Adde hereunto, that remembrance is necessarily vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of things absent. Men may well make rehearsals or remembrances of the valors of a King in his owne presence, but those rehearsals or remembrances are not remembran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Kings person being present, but of his actions past. So the sepulchers of Martyrs were called the memories of Martyrs, because they put men in mind of their sufferings past. It cannot but very improperly be said, that the person of a Martyr is in his tombe, when the best part thereof is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and that which resteth is consumed to dust. The ashes of a Martyr are not the person of the Martyr.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 These words, <hi>Do this,</hi> are so clearely and manifestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that there is no contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to be made. For 1. Cor. 11.25.26. after he had said, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> for an exposition of these words he addeth, saying, <hi>For as often as you shall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, you shew the Lords death till he comes.</hi> To do
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:11462:233"/> this therefore in remembrance of Iesus Christ, is to eate this bread and to drinke this cup, to shew and celebrate his death, and not to sacrifice it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 Moreouer in all the action of this Sacrament, we see no shew nor apparence of a sacrifice. First, Iesus Christ spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not of a sacrifice nor of an offering. Secondly, Iesus Christ presenteth nothing vnto God, but to his disciples, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Take, eate.</hi> Now whosoeuer offereth a sacrifice to God, presenteth something vnto him, and prayeth God to accept of his offering. Thirdly, Iesus Christ did not lift vp the host, which is a common custome and vse in all sacrifices. Fourthly, the Apostles did not adore the host, but sate still at the table without vsing any adoration. For although they had Iesus Christ ordinarily present with them, yet they did neuer eate him, nor euer were present at any such kind of sacrifice. And if euery sacrifice requireth adoration, how much more then such, and so admirable a sacrifice? specially in an action, which should serue for a patterne and an example in the Church, to conforme men thereunto in time to come? And if any one (when the host is lifted vp) to conforme himselfe to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Apostles, should sit still, without adoring it, should he not be thought and esteemed to be a prophane per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son? And if he were in Spaine or Italie, should he not be sent to the Inquisition? And yet in the person of such a man they should make a processe against the Apostles.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 It is to be considered, that if the body of Iesus Christ be really sacrificed in the Masse, it is conuenient and very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that the bread should be consecrated before they sacrifice it. And therein we agree with our aduersaries. Which being graunted, I reason thus: Whosoeuer offereth an obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vnto God, necessarily speaketh vnto God. But in this action, after the words which they say are consecrating words, Iesus Christ speaketh not to God, <hi>Ergo,</hi> in this action after the consecrating words, Iesus Christ offereth no obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God. The action of thanks-giuing and the blessing of the bread went before the words that are called consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting words; therefore they can be no part of that sacrifice. For
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:11462:233"/> that to blesse bread, and to giue thankes to God, is not to sacrifice it to God. This blessing is vsed at all meale times, and Iesus Christ did it at the distribution by him made of the loues of bread in the desert.<note place="margin">Matth. 14.19. Luc 9.16.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6 It is to be noted that the Councell of Trent saith, that this sacrifice is truly propitiatory,<note place="margin">Hoc sacrificiū laudu pro re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptione a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimarum.</note> and that in the Canon of the Masse, the Priest saith, that he offereth a sacrifice for the redemption of soules. If the Masse be a sacrifice of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, necessarily it must be called so, either because the death of Iesus Christ is applyed vnto vs thereby, or because Iesus Christ dieth in the Masse, and suffereth there for our redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it is not because Iesus Christ dieth in the Masse; for Rom. 6.9. <hi>Iesus Christ being raised from the dead, dieth no more.</hi> Then the Masse must be propitiatory, and a sacrifice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, because in it the death of Iesus Christ is applyed vnto vs, which onely is the price of our redemption. But if that be so, Baptisme and the preaching of the Gospell, and faith in Iesus Christ, are sacrifices of redemption, and sacrifices truly propitiatory. Adde hereunto, that to apply the sacrifice of the Crosse vnto vs, which is the death of our Lord, it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conuenient, nor possible to sacrifice the Lord againe. For as to apply a plaister, or to make a payment of mony, we need not another plaister, nor another payment: So to apply the reall sacrifice of the body of Christ vnto vs, we must not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sacrifice the body of Christ. By that reason, to apply the death of Iesus Christ vnto vs, we must make Christ die a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. And in so important a thing, we must ground vpon the word of God, and shew that God will haue vs to apply the death of our Lord, by sacrificing him really in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charist.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 There is no reason more absurd, then to apply a ransome payd for vs, vnto vs by paying it againe. Yet this is done in the Romish Church, which will haue the faithfull to apply vnto themselues the redemptiō of their soules made for them on the crosse, by offering the same redemption againe, and by sacrificing Iesus Christ againe in a sacrifice of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <pb n="424" facs="tcp:11462:234"/>
                  <p n="8">8 Moreouer, that which our aduersaries do is cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to that which they pretend to do: for to offer Iesus Christ to God▪ is not an application and an appropriating of him vnto our selues. There is as much difference betweene these two things, as there is betweene giuing a thing to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and keeping it for our selues. In the holy Supper we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the sacrifice of Iesus Christ vnto our selues, by receiuing and accepting it by faith, as giuing himselfe vnto vs; and not by offering him as a sacrifice to God.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 I would haue our aduersaries tell me, whether the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption or propitiation which the Priest offereth and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to God in the Masse, be all one with the propitiation which Iesus Christ offered and made on the crosse, or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If it be the same, necessarily the Priest must offer a reall sacrifice of the death of Iesus Christ, which is impossible; for Iesus Christ dieth not really in the Masse. If it be another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and propitiation, then there is two prices of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, and another propitiation for our soules besides the death of Iesus Christ, and vnder shadow of applying the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption made on the crosse, to vs, they substitute another redemption, and so forge another Gospell.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 The Apostle to the Hebrewes witnesseth excellently of this matter, he speaketh much of the office of a sacrifice according to <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> without speaking of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist: whereby it followeth, that the Eucha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ist is not the sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of <hi>Melchisedech.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="11">11 Besides in Hebrewes 10.14. it is said, That Iesus Christ <hi>with one offering hath reconciled for euer them that are sanctified.</hi> Here is one onely oblation or offering, and the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue thereof for euer. And to exclude the reiteration thereof, in the tenth verse he saith, <hi>That we are sanctified euen by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of the body of Iesus Christ once made.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="12">12 They answer and say, that he offered himselfe but once in a bloudy sacrifice, but that he is offered diuers times in a sacrifice that is not bloudy. Which is a manifest errour; for, to offer himselfe diuers times in a sacrifice without bloud, is alwaies to offer himselfe diuers times, and so to contradict
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:11462:234"/> the Apostle. Adde hereunto, that the bloudy sacrifice is found in the Scripture, but there is no mention made of the sacrifice of Iesus Christ without bloud. To mocke the Scripture by distinctions vnwritten, is vnder pretence of interpreting, to correct the Scripture. And our aduersaries hauing rackt the words of the institution of the holy Supper, finde nothing therein but their owne condemnation. For, to alledge the words of Iesus Christ saying▪ <hi>This cup is the new Testament in my blo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d which is shed for you,</hi> to prooue a sacrifice without bloud, is to cōdemne themselues: because those words speake of effusion of bloud, and not of a sacrifice without bloud. To prooue a sacrifice wherein there is no bloud shed, by a place that speaketh of shedding of bloud is as good an argument, as if to excuse theft, a man should alledge the law which saith, <hi>Thou shalt not steale.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13 Therefor the Apostle preuenteth this excuse; for Hebr. 9.25.26. after he had said that Iesus Christ <hi>did not offer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe oftentimes,</hi> he addeth, <hi>That then he must haue suffered often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times.</hi> Manifestly shewing, that he acknowledged no other sacrifice of Iesus Christ but his passion. And to cut off all dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, he addeth, verse. 27.28. <hi>And as it is appointed vnto men that they should once die, and after that commeth the iudgement: So Christ was once offered to take away the sinnes of many, and vnto them that looke for him, shall he appeare the second time, without sinne, vnto saluation.</hi> Now where is the distinction of a bloudy and no bloudy sacrifice? seeing that the Apostle sheweth, that as a man can die but once, so Christ offered himselfe but once? How ridiculous a thing should it be, for one to say, that a man can die but once bloudily, but diuers times vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudily?</p>
                  <p n="14">14 The same Apostle, in the same chapter and the 22 verse, after he had spoken of sacrifices and purifications of the law, concludeth by this generall maxime, <hi>That without shedding of bloud there is no remission of sinnes.</hi> If then the Masse be no bloudy sacrifice, there is no remission of sinnes made by it. And you must note that he speaketh of the present time, saying, <hi>There is no remission of sinnes:</hi> lest men should thinke
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:11462:235"/> that he spake onely of Iudaicall sacrifices that were aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. The Apostle will haue this rule to be certaine at this present time. Note also, that the Apostle saith not, that there is no remission of sinnes, but by the vertue of bloud-shedding: but he saith, that in sacrifices there is no remission of sinnes without effusion of bloud. It is nothing to the purpose, to seeke in the old Testament for examples of propitiatory sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, wherein no bloud was shed: as the goate of <hi>Azazel,</hi> or the Scape-goate, which was sent away aliue into the desert laden with the sinnes of the people, Leuit. 16.20. That is not to dispute against vs, but against the Apostle. And yet that goate was but a part of the sacrifice: there being two goates, wherof the one was killed, the other let go, and both of them were but one sacrifice. As in the sacrifice of two sparrowes, whereof one was killed,<note place="margin">Leuit. 14.</note> the other let flie away; one to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent the death of our Lord, the other, to be a figure of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection: which two things could not be represented by one beast. If our aduersaries find reasons to prooue that propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory sacrifices without shedding of bloud, ought to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed vnder the new Testament, the same reasons of like force are to be found vnder the old Testament: where neuerthelesse they were not suffered to be done.</p>
                  <p n="15">15 He that is carefull of his owne saluation, will consider what kind of religion that is, which maketh two sacrifices of redemption, wherein Iesus Christ is really sacrificed. Two sacrifices of Iesus Christ differing in <hi>specie</hi> and in definition, in proprietie, in accidents, and in efficacie. For the sacrifice of the crosse is the death of Iesus Christ, but the sacrifice of the Masse is not the death of Iesus Christ. The one is a painfull sacrifice, the other without paine. The one bloudy, the other without bloud. The one wherein the body of Iesus Christ is broken, the other wherein it remaineth whole. The one visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the other inuisible. The one done but once, the other which is done a thousand millions of times. The one done immediatly by Iesus Christ, the other by the hand of a Priest. The one which being offered was sufficient for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all mankinde; the other, which is repeated a thousand
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:11462:235"/> times, to draw one soule out of Purgatory. The one which is done freely, the other which is sold for money. The one offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the remission of sinnes, and for the saluation of mens soules; the other which is offered for a sicke horse, for corne that is blasted, for the successe of a voyage, and to be short, which serueth for all things, but not for the saluation of soules. White is not more contrary vnto blacke, nor heauen more distant from the earth, then there is difference betweene these two sacrifices.</p>
                  <p n="16">16 This pretended sacrifice without effusion of bloud, is contrary to the nature of all sacrifices so called properly. For both we and our aduersaries say, that in euery sacrifice pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called a sacrifice, the thing that is offered must be visible, and that visible thing must be destroyed by the sacrifice. In this it is cleane contrary. For in this sacrifice, Iesus Christ which is the thing sacrificed, is not seene, nor perceiued; and he is so farre off from being visible vnder the <hi>species</hi> or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of bread, that on the contrary, it is the accidents that hide him, &amp; make him inuisible, if we beleeue our aduersaries. And that which is destroyed in the Masse, is not the thing which is offered vnto God. The body of Iesus which they pretend to sacrifice, suffereth no distruction in the Masse. For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of a liuing thing is nothing else but death. The accidents onely are destroyed, which are not offered vnto God. And if (as our aduersaries say) the sacramentall being of Iesus Christ is destroyed, it followeth that the same sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall being is sacrificed. Then that sacramentall being is the price of our redemption: for that which is sacrificed to God, ought to be the price of our redemption. Now Iesus Christ in his naturall being is our redemption, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed vpon the Crosse, and not in a sacramentall being, that is, significantly, which is a <hi>Chimaera,</hi> and a meere fiction. So that nothing is destroyed in the sacrifice of the Masse which can be our redemption. Adde hereunto, that the destruction of the <hi>species</hi> or accidents being done onely in the Priests sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, when the same <hi>species</hi> dissolue by digestion, we ought to say, that the sacrifice is not done till certaine houres
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:11462:236"/> after the Masse is finished, and that the Priests stomacke is the altar, and that the sacrifice is made two or three houres in the afternoone.</p>
                  <p n="17">17 And when it is to be defined, in what action or part of the Masse the sacrifice formally consisteth, nothing troubleth our Doctours more then that, notwithstanding all their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiltie. If they say, they sacrifice consisteth in the eleuation of the host, then Iesus Christ did not sacrifice, for he vsed no such eleuation: if in the breaking of the consecrated bread, then Iesus Christ did not sacrifice, for he brake the bread before he pronounced those words wherein the Church of Rome make the Consecration to consist. And if that which is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Eucharist or Sacrament is sacrificed, by that rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning Iesus Christ sacrificed nothing but bread. And Iesus Christ remaineth whole vnder the <hi>species</hi> of bread and wine, and by consequence is not broken vnder the <hi>species,</hi> and therefore is not sacrificed.</p>
                  <p>And if they say, the sacrifice consisteth in the eating, then the Priests mouth is the altar for the sacrifice; and by that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,<note place="margin">Snaè dici po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, quòd Christus vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute diuina confecit: &amp; postea formam expressit sub qua posteri benedicerent.

                  <p>They are no lesse troubled touching the Consecration, that is, whether the Sacrifice formally consisteth in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration; for they agree not among themselues about the words by the which Christ consecrated. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, in the sixt chapter and fourth booke of the Masse, is of opinion, that Iesus Christ did not consecrate by these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> but that he had consecrated before by his diuine vertue. And all the ancient Fathers with one accord say, that Consecration is made by prayer. Whereupon the Grecians call Consecration, <hi>Inuocation,</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi> At this day they say, that Consecration is done by these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> which are no words of Sacrifice nor Oblation, because they offer nothing vnto God, neither are directed vnto God, but to the Apostles; <hi>Take, eate, this is my bodie which is broken for you.</hi> And if to consecrate be to sacrifice, then by this reason it will follow, that consecrating of daies,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:11462:236"/> of the Temple, and of the vessels belonging thereunto, are so many Sacrifices.</p>
                  <p n="18">18 Touching this point we haue inuincible reasons, which hold our Aduersaries so fast bound that they can by no means vnloose themselues. They say, (and that with good reason) that in all Sacrifices, that which is offered vnto God ought to be consecrated. But in the Masse, that which is sacrificed to God, is not consecrated. Therefore nothing is sacrificed vnto God in the Masse. That no consecrated thing is offered to God in the Masse, it appeareth hereby; that if any conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated thing is offered to God in the Masse, it must either be the Bread, or the accidents of the Bread, or else the Body of Christ. But it is not the Bread, for it is no more bread, (as they say) after the consecrating words are pronounced; nor the accidents of the Bread, for they are not offred vnto God: The colour, the roundnesse, and the breadth of the bread, without bread, is not a fit and proper offering for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. Nor the body of Iesus Christ, for he cannot be consecrated by vs; seeing that on the contrarie, it is he that consecrateth vs, as the Apostle saith, Hebr. 10.14. <hi>For with one offering hath he consecrated for euer them that are sanctified.</hi> So there is nothing that is consecrated in the Masse which the Priest can offer vnto God. Here our Aduersaries are at a stay, and say that the bread is consecrated, but tell not what consecrated thing is offered to God in the Masse.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 With the like subtiltie they alledge the Paschall Lamb, to proue that the Eucharist is a Sacrifice. They say, the Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chall Lambe was a Sacrifice: and therefore, that the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist which is ordained in stead thereof, is a Sacrifice. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they go about to proue that which is not in question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene vs: The speciall point of difference is. Whether the body of Christ is really sacrificed in the Eucharist; and not, Whether the Eucharist is in some sence a Sacrifice.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 They likewise make a great shew of the place in Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie 1.11. where it is said; <hi>For from the rising of the Sunne, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto the going downe of the same, my Name shall be great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles, and in euery place Incense shall be offered vnto my Name, and a pure offering.</hi> In this place I see nothing spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of sacrificing the bodie of Christ, nor of making a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatorie Sacrifice for the liuing and for the dead. In more then a dozen places of the New Testament, prayers, almes, puritie and innocencie of life, and the worke of the Ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie are called Sacrifices. In that sence I doubt not but that the holy Supper may be called a Sacrifice; but yet a Sacrifice of Eucharist, that is, a sacrifice of Thanks-giuing. And the word Oblation in <hi>Malachie</hi> is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>minha,</hi> which signifieth a Cake, with aspersion of oyle, which was not offered in a propitiatorie sacrifice, but in a sacrifice of Thanks-giuing.</p>
                  <p>This exposition disliketh our Aduersaries: for they will haue this pure oblation to be the sacrifice of the Masse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Iesus Christ is sacrificed. An interpretation drawne out of the vnwritten word. For the Scripture speaketh not of sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficing the body of Iesus Christ in the Masse; neither is there any shew thereof in that place.</p>
                  <p>The reasons why they reiect our exposition, although it be grounded vpon the Scripture, are, because prayers and
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:11462:238"/> almes are no new things, in that they were vsed in the Old Testament; and here (they say) he speakes of a new Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I answer, that the ministerie of the Gospell, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christian faith, are new things, and not vsed in the Old Testament: and those things also are called Sacrifices, Rom. 15.15.16. I say the same of the holy Supper, which by the same reason may be called a Sacrifice of Praise, and of Thankes-giuing. And also, that touching the manner and forme of praying in the name of Iesus Christ, it beganne with the publication of the Gospell. And it is euident, that the same which <hi>Malachie</hi> specifieth to be new, is, that pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and spirituall offerings should beginne to be offered to God, from the rising of the Sunne to the going downe of the same, by the vocation of the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>But they reply, That prayers, almes, and spi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ituall Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, cannot be that pure offering, seeing that we say, that our best workes are vncleane and imperfect. I could shew, that they wrong vs herein; but it sufficeth at this time, that the Ministerie of the Gospel, and the Sacrament of the holy Supper, cannot (without blasphemie) be called impure or vncleane; for although that he which administreth them is a sinner, that changeth not their nature. The puritie of the Gospell and of the Sacraments dependeth not vpon the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of those that pronounce and administer them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The rest of the places which they alledge out of the old Testament, seeme rather to be alledged in ieast, then for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; in 1. of <hi>Samuel</hi> 2.35. God foresheweth to <hi>Hely,</hi> that he would take the office of Priest from him, and would raise vp vnto himselfe a faith full Priest, to whom he would build a sure house. And Prouerbs 9.1. <hi>Wisedome hath built her house, she hath killed her beasts, she hath mingled her wine, she hath also furnished her table.</hi> Therefore (say they) the Priest sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificeth Iesus Christ in the Masse. To prooue the Masse by those places of the Scripture, is all one as to warme them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by Moone light.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Now let vs come to the new Testament. First, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge these words, <hi>This is my body.</hi> But we will speake of the
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:11462:238"/> sence of these words hereafter when we come to Transsub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation. Now we say, put the case it were so, that by these words the bread should be transsubstantiated into the body of Christ; what makes that for the sacrifice? Is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of our Lord Iesus Christ sacrificed in euery place where it is? And say that the body of Iesus Christ should be really in the Priests hands, yet the Priest must not sacrifice it, vnlesse God command him to do it. Now that is it which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to see, but they could neuer yet produce it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Being put from that, they insist vpon the words that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, <hi>This is my body which is giuen for you,</hi> or <hi>which is broken for you.</hi> From whence they inferre, that seeing those words are spoken of the present time, it must needs be that Iesus Christ at that present time brake his body, &amp; gaue it to his disciples.</p>
                  <p>This is to play with the Scriptures, and (in effect) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the Bible and their beleefe. For they which dispute in that manner, might learne by the Romish Bible, by the Masse, and by their owne Doctors, that Iesus Christ by those words speaketh of giuing his body to die for vs, and of the breaking of his bodie vpon the crosse. For that which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Which is broken for you,</hi> the Romane translation saith, <hi>Quod pro vobis tradetur, which shall be giuen for you.</hi> And in the consecration of the cup, in stead of <hi>Which is shed,</hi> both the Romish Bible and the Masse, haue <hi>Effundetur, which shall be shed.</hi> To giue them to vnderstand, that he spake not of any effusion then made, but of that which should be made at his death. It was our Sauiours manner and vse to speake in that sort. Matth. 26.45. Before any of the Iewes were come to lay hands on him, he said, <hi>Behold the Sonne of man is giuen into the hands of sinners.</hi> And Ioh. 10.17. <hi>I lay down my life, that I might take it againe:</hi> and 17.11. <hi>Now I am no more in the world,</hi> and a little after, <hi>When I was in the world, &amp;c.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 2.

So Saint <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome</hi> vnderstood it, in his 83. Sermon vpon Saint Mathew;

                  <p>It cannot be said, that these words, <hi>is giuen</hi> and <hi>is broken,</hi> can be vnderstood presently and futurely: for one selfe same word cannot signifie both present and future. For the Masse and the Romish Bible should do wrong to translate those words in the future tence, if they were to be vnderstood in the present tence. Those interpreters which translate that which is spoken in the present tence, by the future tence, do it because there is an inconuenience to vnderstand it in the present tence, &amp; to follow precisely the letter. And it is not to be doubted, that if he which set that downe in the Canon of the Masse, had beléeued the real sacrifice, as at this day it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued, he would haue left the word <hi>effundetur</hi> in the present tence to ground his owne opinion, and would not haue rested himselfe vpon so weake a ground as otherwise the Gospel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foords him; I say a weake ground, because those words read in the present tence, and translated according to the Greeke copie, make nothing for the reall sacrifice of Christs body in the Eucharist. For the action it selfe which is a Sacrament, bindeth vs to beleeue that they are sacramentall words, and that the sence of those words is, that in the Eucharist the body of our Lord is broken, and his bloud sacramentally shed, to represent the breaking and the shedding of his body
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:11462:239"/> and bloud vpon the crosse. In the same manner that the bread in that place is called the body of Christ, and the cup the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant. Therefore it is expedient to translate it in the present tence, that all the speech may be sacramentall, and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the nature of the action. For the clearing of the truth hereafter, nothing maketh more then the diuersitie of the words which Saint <hi>Luke</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> vse touching the same; the one saying, <hi>Which is giuen,</hi> the other saying, <hi>Which is broken.</hi> For if Saint <hi>Luke</hi> vnderstands, that the body of our Lord is really and actually giuen in the Sacrament, we must also say that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> vnderstood, that in the same Sacrament the body of our Lord is really and actually broken. For they are things disagreeing, to say, that the body of our Lord is really broken vnder the <hi>species</hi> of bread and wine, and yet that it is whole vnder the <hi>species.</hi> The body of our Lord is not broken vnder the <hi>species,</hi> seeing it remaineth whole vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>species.</hi> They are as much combred about the shedding of the bloud. For they say, that the bloud of our Lord is shed in the Eucharist, and yet that it stirreth not, and that it comes not out of the body nor from the veines. That it is shed vnder the <hi>species,</hi> and yet that it stirreth not from vnder the <hi>species.</hi> And as it is certaine that all shedding is a mouing, they make a shedding without mouing. They say that the bloud of the body of Christ is shed, and yet that not one drop of bloud comes out. These men are angry when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted, and in the meane time they contradict rhemselues: they will be beleeued, and yet they beleeue not that which themselues say.</p>
                  <p>And this is yet more absurd which the Romish Churches beleeue, to wit, that the body is whole in euery drop of the wine in the cup, and that in the cup the bloud is not out of the body: in such manner, that it is the body which is shed and the Priest drinks the flesh and the bones.

                  <p>The first proposition is not vniuersally true. For there is a sacramentall and not a reall shedding of bloud, which is made to represent the shedding of Christs bloud vpon the crosse: that is no propitiatorie sacrifice. Therefore to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the ambiguitie, the first proposition ought to be made in this manner, All reall shedding of bloud made for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of sinnes, is a propitatory sacrifice. And yet still the proposition will beare exceptions. For in the circumcision of Iesus Christ, there was reall shedding of the Lords bloud made for the remission of our sinnes, and yet circumcision was no sacrifice. The reall shedding of bloud is then a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory sacrifice, when it is made by the death of the thing offered.</p>
                  <p>The second proposition also is false: for in the Eucharist Iesus Christ saith that his bloud is shed, but saith not, that it was shed in the Eucharist. In this question we speake of a reall shedding, without which there can be no reall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitiatory sacrifice.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 But there are two particular reasons why the holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:11462:241"/> may be called a sacrifice. First, because that Sacrament was instituted to declare the death of our Lord, vntill he comes againe, 1. Cor. 11.26. In that sence the holy Supper may be called a sacrifice, because it representeth the sacrifice of the death of our Lord: as the manner is, that signes and representations ordinarily haue the names of that which they signifie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It may be said, that in the holy Supper we offer Iesus Christ vnto God, in as we pray much as vnto God that he would receiue the sacrifice of his death for a satisfaction for our sinnes.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Thirdly, the holy Supper is a sacrifice of thanksgiuing for the benefites which God hath bestowed vpon vs; speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for the benefit of our redemption by Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The ancient Church had a particular reason to call the holy Supper a sacrifice: for then the custome and manner was, that euery communicant brought gifts and presents which they set vpon the table, whereof one part was employed for the holy Supper, the rest was for the nourishment of the poore: and those presents were called sacrifices and oblations. Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in the ninth Epistle of his first booke commandeth Priests, that receiuing the offerings of the people which contributed, they should not depart from the altar nor from the sacrifice. And in his Sermon of Almes, he saith, Thou rich woman, which thinkest to celebrate the Supper of the Lord, which hast no care to bring an offering, which comest to the Supper of the Lord without a sacrifice, which takest part of the sacrifice which the poore haue offered. Reade <hi>Theodoretus</hi> in the third booke of his Historie, chap. 12. and lib. 4. cap. 19. For these causes the ancient Fathers ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily called that Sacrament a sacrifice. Which they did the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because that thereby they brough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> infidels and Pagans to Christian religion: for their opinion was that a religion without sacrifices was no religion: as by the reproches that Pagans gaue to Christians it appeareth. For <hi>Origen</hi> in his fourth booke against <hi>Celsus,</hi> faith, that Christians had neither altars, images, nor temples. And in the Dialogue of <hi>Minutius
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:11462:241"/> Foelix,</hi> the Pagan <hi>Caecilius</hi> saith, <hi>Cur nullas aras habenti Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiani, nulla templa, nulla nota simulacra?</hi> How cometh it that the Christians haue no altars, temples, nor images that are seene? And in the beginning of the 7. booke of <hi>Arnobius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quid ergo? Sacrificia cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setis nulla om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nino esse faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enda? Resp. Nulla.</note> the Pagans faid, Do you thinke that no sacrifices are to be made? Whereunto the Christians answered and said, No, none at all.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, there are two sorts of sacrifices, the one propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatorie for our redemption, the other the Eucharisticall or sacrifice of thanksgiuing. The holy Supper is a propitiatory sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice significantly and in commemoration, in the same manner that the cup is the Testament, that the bread is the body of Christ, that circumcision was the couenant of God, and that the rocke from whence water issued foorth was Christ, as the Scripture saith. But to speake properly, the holy Supper is a sacrifice of thanksgiuing, &amp; as it is said in the Canon of the Masse, <hi>Sacrificium laudis,</hi> a sacrifice of praise. Therefore the ancient Fathers called it Eucharist, that is, a thansgiuing.</p>
                  <p>You must not thinke it strange that one selfe same action should be called a Sacrament and a sacrifice. Albeit there is as much difference betweene a Sacrament and a sacrifice, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene giuing, and taking or receiuing; for you may obserue both these in the Lords holy Supper, which is a Sacrament, because therein God giueth and communicateth his graces vnto vs; and a sacrifice, because therein we offer praise and thanksgiuing vnto him.</p>

If by these words the Priest vnderstandeth that he speaketh of the bread and the wine, and giueth thankes to God, because he alwaies createth and quickneth those things, he falleth into three ineuitable absurdities. The first is, that he giueth thankes to God, because he createth the bread and the wine in the Eucharist, when according to their doctrine there is neither bread nor wine. The second is, That he she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth the bread and the wine as being present, saying <hi>All these good things,</hi> whē those things are no more those things, being (as they say) transsubstantiated into flesh and bloud.

<pb n="444" facs="tcp:11462:244"/> time when the Priest lifts vp the Host to cause it to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But is not this a thing against all reason and apparence, that then when men adore the Host, and when they sacrifice the eternall Sonne of God to God for the redemption of soules, in stead of praising God for so great a benefite, they giue him thankes▪ because he maketh the corne to grow, and that he createth and blesseth it continually? That is all one in effect, as if when God admitteth any one into the Church by Baptisme, men should giue thankes vnto God, because he created the water, and maketh fountaines and riuers continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to runne.</p>

                     <p>Places alledged to the contrary. Iohn <hi>3.3.</hi> Verily verily I say vnto thee, Except a man be borne againe, he canot see the kingdome of heauen.

                     <p>Places noted in the margent of the Confession, Matth. <hi>19.14.</hi> But Iesus said, Suffer the little children, and forbid them not to come to me, for of such is the kingdome of heauen.

If this word <hi>holy</hi> were not an equiuocation, this place would haue some shew for them; but it is too manifest &amp; plaine, that the word <hi>holy</hi> when it is spoken of children, ought to be taken in the same sence as a little before in the same place it beareth, where and
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:11462:245"/> when it is spoken of a man and his wife. For neither the one nor the other being infidels, are properly sanctified by him that is faithfull. Then this sanctification as well of the married couple, as of their children, consisteth herein, that as marriage is holy because it is lawfull, and in this sence those that are married are sanctified one by the other: so the children that are borne of that marriage are holy, because they are lawfully begotten, and issued from an holy marriage. Therefore the Apostle vnderstands, that if the faithfull should by diuorce separate himselfe from the infidell, onely because of infidelitie, two mischiefes would thereby ensue; the one, that the infidell thereby should not haue the meanes to be conuerted, nor to be sanctified by conuersation with the faithfull: the other, that the children left with the infidell, which would conuert then to his owne religion, could not be taught the faith and worshipping of God, as they are when their fathers and mothers liue together.</p>

                     <p>To <hi>baptize</hi> is a Greeke word, which signifieth to dip into the water or to wash. In this generall sence washings in the old Testament are called baptismes,<note n="*" place="margin">

                           </gap>.</note> Hebr. 9.10.</p>
                     <p>The word Baptisme is sometimes taken figurately, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction and persecution for the Gospell: as Marke. 10.38. where it is said, <hi>Can ye drinke of the cup that I shall drinke of, and be baptized with the baptisme that I shall be baptized with?</hi> Speaking of the participation of his afflictions. See Luke 12.59. Oftentimes also it is taken for purging and sanctifying of
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:11462:245"/> the heart, and for effusion of the graces of the holy Ghost. So Acts 1.5. Christ promiseth his disciples, <hi>That they should be baptized with the holy Ghost, within few daye.</hi> And <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> saith, <hi>That Iesus Christ baptizeth vs with the holy Ghost, and with fire, Math.</hi> 3.11.</p>
                     <p>But ordinarily Baptisme is taken for the Sacrament of our entrance into the Christian Church, and of the clensing of our sinnes by the bloud of Iesus Christ, and by the power and efficacie of his Spirit. A Sacrament which Iesus Christ hath sanctified in his owne person, and established by his owne ordinance. Which succeeded circumcision, by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> called the seale of the righteousnesse of faith, Rom. 4.11.</p>
                     <p>This Baptisme is conserued by dipping him into, or sprinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of water vpon him that is baptized, saying, <hi>I baptise thee in the name of the Father, and of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost,</hi> Matth. 28.19.</p>
                     <p>If we take this word Baptisme generally for a washing or a sprinckling, or in a figuratiue sence for affliction, or for the effusion of the graces of the holy Ghost, we confesse that there are diuers baptismes: As the Apostle Hebr. 6.2. spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of <hi>the doctrine of baptismes</hi> in the plurall number. But if we take it for that sprinckling of water which is a marke of Christianitie, and a Sacrament of our entring into the Church, there is but one Baptisme: as the Apostle saith Ephes. 4.5.6. <hi>There is one Lord, one Faith, one Baptisme, one God, one Father of all.</hi> The Greeke saith <hi>Baptisme is one.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching this Baptisme, men dispute whether it be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie to saluation. First, we will speake of the necessitie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in those persons which are capable of instruction, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the same in little children.</p>

For which cause, in the same chapter Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> is alledged in the eight booke of the Citie of God, saying. <hi>Baptismus inuisibiliter ministratur, quem non contemptus religionis, sed terminus necessitatis excludit:</hi> Baptisme is inuisibly administred to him that hath bene debarred thereof, not by contempt of religion, but by necessitie of time preuenting him. And thereupon the Glosse of the Canonists Doctors noteth that the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> died without baptisme, and that neuerthelesse <hi>Ambrose</hi> in his Oration made vpon the death of that Emperour, saith that he was blessed in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. That which is specially to be noted in this Historie, is, that the Emperour <hi>Valentinian</hi> was a Christian borne, and had a thousand meanes to haue bene baptized, if he would.</p>
                  <p>To the same end, and to make baptisme by water vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, the Church of Rome speaketh of two other bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismes which supply the want of baptisme by water, which are, baptisme of the spirit, which is sanctification and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour renewing wrought by the Spirit of God; and baptisme
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:11462:246"/> by bloud which is martyrdome. But these two allegoricall baptismes are no Sacraments. For conuersion and renewing of a mans mind from sinnes, are not conferred by the ministerie of men, but it is a worke of the Spirit of God: wherein there is no element, nor any words added to the element. This can be no Sacrament of the new Testament, seeing that the same spirituall renewing was necessary in the old Testament. And it cannot be said that this worke of the holy Ghost in the hearts of the faithfull doth supply the want of baptisme, seeing it is necessarie to saluation, whether a man be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, or not baptized.</p>
                  <p>Martyrdome also is no Sacrament of the new Testament, for that the same was in the old Testament. And the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent declareth, that Sacraments are not conferred, if he that conferreth them hath not an intent to confer them. And it is not to be thought nor beleeued, that the executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of martyrs haue an intent to confer a Sacrament at their executions. And there is no likelihood, that of two Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, whereof the one is baptized, the other not baptized, the martyrdome of the one should be a baptisme, and the others none. Neither can I see how the martyrdome of a man that is drowned or strangled without any effusion of bloud, can be called a baptisme or washing in bloud. Besides that, we often deceiue our selues in this word <hi>Martyr.</hi> For 1. Cor. 13.3. the Apostle sheweth, that a man may giue his body to be burned, and yet haue no charity. It is a common thing among men to suffer martyrdome, to win reputation. Among a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the faithfull that are massacred in their beds without any leisure to speake, it is not vnlikely but that some of them would haue recanted for feare, if they had had any respite giuen them to thinke thereon. So that in calling him a Martyr which in Gods iudgement is not so, we giue the name of baptisme to sufferings which are vnworthy the name of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome.</p>
                  <p>To be short: that rule so often times repeated in the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which is, <hi>That whosoeuer beleeueth in Iesus Christ, shall haue life euerlasting,</hi> will beare no exception. Therefore he
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:11462:247"/> that hath the faith of a Martyr, and loueth God more then his owne life, although God exempteth him from marryrdome, doth not lose the same reward. For God doth not reward the paines but the vertue of a man. Because dolour and paine for martyrdome cannot be suffered by Hypocrits, but faith is proper to the children of God, to whom life eternall is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised: for the want of baptisme by default of meanes cannot annihilate Gods promise.</p>

                  <p>But seeing that in the Church of Rome the godfather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth for the child which is baptized, and forsaketh the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell for him, saying, <hi>Credo &amp; abrenuntio,</hi> I maruell why the same godfather cannot also make a vow for the child, seeing that the Councell of Trent teacheth, that a vow supplyeth the want of baptisme.</p>

<pb n="451" facs="tcp:11462:247"/> to saluation. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the 5. chapter of his first booke of Baptisme, saith,<note n="*" place="margin">Baptismus Christi nō fuit neeessarius, necessitate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dij aut praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, ante Christi mortem.</note> That the Baptisme of Iesus Christ, was neither a necessary meanes, nor a necessary commandement before the death of Iesus Christ.

But there is no apparence that that Baptisme which at this day is conferred by a Pagan, by a Iew, or by a woman should be more necessary, and of more efficacie then that which was administred by Iesus Christ and by his Apostles. It is to no purpose to say, that circumcision did then supply that which wanted in the baptisme which Iesus Christ conferred.

                  <p>Many Doctors of the Church of Rome, being confuted by the force of truth, beleeued that children might be saued without baptisme with water. That is the opinion of <hi>Gerson</hi> Chancelor of the Vniuersitie of Paris, in his Sermon of the Natiuitie of the virgine <hi>Marie;</hi> and of <hi>Gabriel Biel</hi> vpon the 4. booke of Sentences, Dist. 4. quest. 2. and of <hi>Lombardus</hi> mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of Sentences, that maintaineth the necessitie of Baptisme, and neuerthelesse (constrained by force of the truth) in the 4. Distinstion, in the letter E. saith.<note n="***" place="margin">Deus suam potentiam sacramentis non alligauit.

<pb n="452" facs="tcp:11462:248"/> then agree with vs, and with the truth. And to that end build an imaginary lodging for little children that die without Baptisme, which they call the Limbus of little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, forged by mens braines without the word of God: where they say those poore children lie in eternall darknes, in a hole or caue vnder the earth, depriued of Gods sight, and of eternall saluation, without dolour and torment, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence without griefe; for perpetuall griefe and sorrow for the losse of our soueraigne good, is a perpetuall torment: and if without griefe to be excluded from the presence of God, then also without knowledge of God, and without the loue of God, which is the greatest euill that can be in a reasonable creature.</p>
                  <p>This Limbus is a field fit to exercise the subtilty of these Doctors, and a subiect to be disputed of when men are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting, to know what the soules of those little children do in that prison vnder ground, seeing that there they haue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with God, nor with the Saints in Paradise, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remembrance of those things which they saw and heard vpon earth, because there they neither saw nor heard any thing. As also whether those children shall rise againe at the latter day, whether they shall appeare before the iudgement seate of Christ: what sentence the Iudge will giue; and how they can heare or comprehend that sentence. Whether they shall remaine still in that caue vnder the ground then when the earth shall be no more, or whether the Pope hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them any other lodging. To what end their eyes and their eares shall serue them in that Limbus after the resurrection: Whether the Pope can draw them from thence by Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as well as Pope <hi>Gregorie</hi> 1. drew the Emperour <hi>Traians</hi> (a Pagans) soule out of hell, if we beleeue our aduersaries. When that horrible custome began which is vsed in the Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall of Paris, where they throw little children (that are dead without Baptisme) into a deepe well, as vnworthy of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny buriall. And lastly, whether that any one euer came from that Limbus to bring them that newes, seeing that God neuer shewed vs of any such thing.</p>

                  <p n="2">2 The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 7.14. speaking of a man and a wife, whereof the one is an infidell, the other a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and of children borne in that marriage, saith that their children are holy, <hi>Otherwise</hi> (saith he) <hi>your children were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, but now they are holy.</hi> If children borne in marriage where but one of the parties is a Christian, are holy by the Apostles iudgement, what apparence is there for men to thinke that those children which are borne of two Christian parents are not holy? and that they should be excluded from the grace of God, vnder pretence that they died without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme? Many of our aduersaries to saue their honesties, say that by the word <hi>holy</hi> is vnderstood children lawfully borne; and that by vncleane children, the Apostle vnderstandeth ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stards and children vnlawfully begotten. Thus they play with
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:11462:249"/> the Scriptures, and contradict themselues. For the Church of Rome is of opinion with vs, that Marriages betweene Pagans are lawfull,<note place="margin">Dist. <hi>26.</hi> Can. Vna tantum.

Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> said to <hi>Herod,</hi> That it was not lawfull for him to haue his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Philips</hi> wife, Matth. 14.4. Then he esteemed that the marriage betweene <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Herodias</hi> his wife was indisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luble, and consequently lawfull. Ancient Christians acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the Pagan Emperors children to be lawfull successors in the Empire, and obeyed them, which they had not bene bound to do, if they had esteemed Pagans marriages to be vnlawfull. Then if Pagans children are legitimate, and that the Apostle calleth all children legitimate (as our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries say) the children of Turkes and Pagans are holy. But it is certaine, that the Apostles intent was not to shew vs how children are holy in that sence, but to shew vs by what meanes children are consecrated to God. The Scripture also neuer calleth a child holy because it is lawfully begotten, but it is an ordinary thing in the Scripture to call those persons and those things holy, which are consecrated to God, and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his seruice. So in the Law euery first borne that opened the matrice was holy vnto God. In the same sence the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the vessels, the sacrifices, and the Sabboth day were ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Lord. So are children that are borne of Christian parents. And seeing that God acknowledgeth them to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, why should the Church of Rome esteeme them to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, and excluded from the couenant of God? It is true that they are borne in originall sinne: but Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, that the bloud of Christ clenseth vs from all sinne: the vertue of which bloud and the efficacie of his death, is not tyed to the water in any such manner, as that when time and meanes faile &amp; are wanting to be baptized, God therfore cannot cause his grace to be felt, and manifest his goodnesse towards the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the faithfull, borne within the couenant of God.</p>
                  <p>Hereby <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> discourse is confuted, which saith, That children are called holy, because they are lawfully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and issued from an holy marriage. We grant him that in that place the children are called holy, in the same sence
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:11462:249"/> that in the same place it is said, that the vnbeleeuing husband is sanctified by the woman. For the Apostle therby teacheth, that the faith and holines of one of the parties, sanctifieth the marriage betwixt the husband and the wife, in such manner that the children born in that mariage are cōsecrated to God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 <hi>Matthew</hi> 19.14, Iesus said, <hi>Suffer the little children to come vnto me, and forbid them not, for to such belongeth the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen.</hi> Those children which were presented vnto him had not as then bene baptized by him nor by his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and yet he declared that the kingdome of God belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnto them. It is true that it appeareth not whether they were circumcised or no, but that is to little purpose, seeing that our aduersaries say, That circumcision doth not bring a man to the kingdome of heauen. Then baptisme was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for those children to enter into the kingdome of heauen, if we beleeue our aduersaries. Adde hereunto, that Iesus Christ saith not, that the kingdome of heauen belongeth to childrē that are circumcised, but simply to children. He considereth the Infancie, and not the Circumcision in them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 To this purpose those places of Scripture may be alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, which say, That God neuer punisheth the innocent for the guiltie, and doth not punish the sonne for the fathers sin, if the sonne doth not participate in his fathers sinne. As Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiel 18.20. saith, <hi>The soule that sinneth, it shall die: The sonne shall not beare the iniquitie of the father, neither shall the father beare the iniquitie of the sonne.</hi> The Church of Rome sinneth against this rule, when they will haue a childe to be for euer excluded from the kingdome of heauen, because his father negligently delayed his baptisme. That is, to punish the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for the guiltie. The example of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne, which brought so many euils vpon his posteritie, is not contrary to this rule; for <hi>Adam</hi> sinned not as a particular man, but as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presenting all mankind in the root. For hauing receiued cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine benefites for himselfe and for his posteritie, he lost them for himselfe and for his posteritie. Moreouer, that euill des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended from <hi>Adam</hi> vpon vs by naturall propagation, which no way can be applied to the wilfull negligence of parents,
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:11462:250"/> in not baptizing their children.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 If we desire to haue more pertinent examples, the holie Scripture furnisheth vs sufficiently. Euery man knowes that Circumcision was the same to the faithfull in the old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Baptisme at this day is vnto vs. And yet infinite numbers of people were saued vnder the old Testamēt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Circumcision, as all the faithful women, and those which truly repented among the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Circumcision was conferred vpon the eight day after the childe was borne. In which time of eight dayes a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of children died, which according to our Aduersaries doctrine must haue bene eternally damned. The goodnesse of God towards all men, specially towards his owne people, and those which feare him, bindeth vs to beleeue, that if Circumcision had bene necessarie to saluation, God would haue commanded children to haue bene circumcised present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after they were borne. He would not haue excluded milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of soules (borne of faithfull parents, and of <hi>Abrahams</hi> posteritie, and to whom the blessing of God was promised,) from his grace, by the delay of eight dayes. For God taketh no pleasure in the destruction of his creatures, much lesse in losing children borne vnder his couenant. If the people of Israel had beleeued that which the Church of Rome belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, they would haue desired <hi>Moses</hi> to haue had a shorter time limited vnto them for circumcision. And there would haue bene great and extraordinarie lamentations made by the Iewes for those children that died before those eight dayes were expired. And it is manifest that the people of the Church of Rome do not beleeue that which they are taught, seeing that the mothers whose children die before they are baptized, are so easily and so soone comforted, and trouble their mindes no more with the eternall perdition of their children.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 But specially the children of Israel that died in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serts, are a notable example herein: For those people omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the vse of Circumcision for the space of forty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in which time there was aboue sixe hundred thousand
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:11462:250"/> men borne, and that died therein: which great multitude of soules are eternally lost, by the iudgement of the Romish Church. And yet those men were they for whom Manna rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned downe from heauen, &amp; whom God couered by day with a pillar of a cloud, and lighted by night with a pillar of fire: which offered sacrifices vnto God, and whose sacrifices God did accept: whom without doubt <hi>Moses</hi> would neuer haue suffered to haue bene vncircumcised, if he had beleeued that without circumcision they could not haue bene saued.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 But what is more contrary to God and to his word, then to make God subiect vnto men, yea, and that he should be subiect to the will of his enemies, in such manner that he openeth and shutteth the entrie into Paradise at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? And yet that is the beleefe of the Church of Rome. For Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi>

By this meanes, if either a Pagan or a Turke hath a Christiā child in his keeping, he can saue or lose the soule of that childe: and if he will baptize that child, it shall be saued; but if he will not, that child dying, is presently cast headlong into eternall darknesse. By this reason, the sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of a Christian child dependeth vpon the wil of a Turk or a Pagan, of whom it is to be beleeued, that he doth confer baptisme no otherwise then for a mockerie or in despite.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 The like absurdities rise from the baptisme of Midwiues, who receiuing a child that dieth in the birth, must haue the saluation of the child in their powers. By this reckoning the Apostles with all their meanes, and with all their wisedome and doctrines neuer did more good to any man then such a Pagan or such a woman do vnto a child, which without them had died without baptisme.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 But is it not an easie matter for a Iew or a Turke hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critically to cause himselfe to be baptized?

                     <hi>M. Arnoux,</hi> to proue that no man can be saued without baptisme with water, alledgeth the third and fift verses of the third chapter of S. <hi>Iohn,</hi> where Iesus Christ saith to <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Ʋerily verily I say vnto thee, except a man be borne againe, he cannot see the kingdome of heauen.</hi> And, <hi>Except a man be borne of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God.</hi> And verse 7. <hi>You must be borne againe.</hi> But our Aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries seruing their turnes with these places, ouerthrow that which they haue set vp. For the Church of Rome is of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that this place doth not proue the absolute necessitie of baptisme with water to all persons: seeing it saith, that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs may be saued without baptisme with water; that those which haue vowed to be baptized, and haue not had conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time and commodious thereunto, may be saued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; and those also that are sanctified by the holy Ghost, as we haue already declared. All those may be saued (as they say) without baptisme with water. And which is more, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Lord Iesus Christ spake vnto <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> yet our Aduersaries say, that baptisme with water was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> because he was circumcised; and that the baptisme of Christ was not necessarie to saluation (by their iudgement) but after his resurrection, as we shewed before. Aboue all things, it is to be considered, that Christ did not onely speake to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> but also for <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> which spake of himselfe, and in respect of himselfe, when he said, How can a man be borne againe when he is old? By this is discouered the nature of errour, which is, to interrupt it selfe, and to vndo that which it hath done. For it is euident, that the Lord spake of a new birth, without which <hi>Nicodemus</hi> could not be saued. But our aduersaries say that <hi>Nicodemus</hi>
                     <pb n="459" facs="tcp:11462:251"/> might be saued without baptisme, because he was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised. How should a man beleeue these Doctors, seeing they beleeue not themselues? and hauing set downe a generall rule to proue, that no man can be saued without baptisme with water, presently after they breake that rule by a multitude of exceptions? The sence of this place is cleare, Iesus Christ spake to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and in him to all those persons that are capable of instruction, and sheweth them that they cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen, if they be not borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in newnesse of life, and regenerated by the holy Ghost: whose grace being infused into our hearts, is a baptisme without the which no man can be saued. And it is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that this rule can beare no exception. For as in Matth. 3.11. it is said, that <hi>Iesus Christ baptizeth vs with the holy Ghost and with fire,</hi> vnderstanding thereby the Spirit mouing and purifying our hearts: so in this place Iesus Christ saith, that to enter into the kingdome of heauen, <hi>We must be borne againe of water and of the spirit;</hi> vnderstanding thereby, <hi>a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall washing,</hi> or the Spirit washing and purifying the heart. The words <hi>to be borne againe,</hi> can receiue no other exposition. For, <hi>to be borne againe,</hi> doth not signifie to be baptized with water, but to be renewed and regenerated in a new life by the Spirit of God. And Iesus Christ plainely sheweth, that he speaketh onely of the efficacie of the Spirit secretly working in our hearts, when (verse the eight) he addeth and saith, <hi>The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it goeth; so is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man that is borne of the Spirit.</hi> Then to be borne of water and of the Spirit, by our Sauiour Iesus Christs owne exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to be simply borne of the Spirit: and this comparison of the winde blowing inuisibly cannot agree with any thing but onely with the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>Yet to gratifie our aduersaries, let vs grant them that Iesus Christ in this place would say, that without the Sacrament of Baptisme with water, we cannot enter into the kingdome of heauen; why should they not herein vse the same equitie of iudgement, and the same discretion which they vse in the
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:11462:252"/> exposition of those places whereby they say that Iesus Christ speaketh of the necessitie of the Eucharist? In Ioh. 6.53. Iesus Christ saith, <hi>Except you eate the flesh of the Son of man, and drinke his bloud, ye haue no life in you.</hi> There our aduersaries restraine Christs words to persons that are of the age of discretion, and that are capable of instruction, and that haue meanes to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate the Eucharist. Then let vs say the same in this place, that is, that Iesus Christ speaketh to men that haue attained to yeares of instruction, and to those that haue meanes to be baptized, which cannot be saued if they despise baptisme. By this meanes our disputation would be at an end, and we should be at agreement with our aduersaries touching the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of baptisme.<note place="margin">Lomb. lib. <hi>4.</hi> Sententiarū. Dist. <hi>4.</hi> litt. &amp; illud intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligendum est de illis qui possunt &amp; contemnunt baptizari.</note> And that is it which the Maister of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences acknowledgeth, saying, That the same place ought to be vnderstood of those that may be baptized, and despise bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme.</p>
                  <p>The marriage of pride with superstition hath begotten this errour. For pride seekerh to exalt the necessitie of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie of men, and to perswade that the grace of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily passeth through their handes. And superstition layeth hold vpon the exteriour action, as if God did nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
                  <p>But in the meane time, while the Church of Rome exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the necessitie of baptisme, it imbaseth the worthinesse thereof, perswading those that beleeue her, that the benefit of Iesus Christ is in such sort applied vnto them thereby, that by the same they are not exempted from satisfying Gods iustice for the punishments and paines of sins by them committed after baptisme. They haue abridged the benefit of Iesus Christ, to make way for their trade. They say that it is no reason that the benefit of the redeemer should as equally exempt those from punishment which haue wittingly sinned after baptisme, as those that sinned by ignorance before bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme. But may it not fall out, that a man may sinne willingly before baptisme, and ignorantly after baptisme? Then why shall sinne which is wittingly committed before baptisme be remitted without any satisfaction: and rhat which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:11462:252"/> by ignorance after baptisme, not be remitted without satisfactorie punishments imposed vpon it by God?</p>
                  <p>The Church of Rome also hath embased baptisme, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting women and Pagans to administer the same, whereas Confirmation is onely conferred by the Bishop: as also by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereunto spittle, salt, and blowing into the eares of those that are baptized: and by baptizing bells and gallies, as if they condemned baptisme to the gallies.</p>

               <q>So we say, that water being a weake element, doth testifie the truth of the interior washing of our soules in the bloud of Iesus Christ, by the efficacy of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; &amp; that the bread and the wine being giuen vnto vs in the Supper, truly serue vs for spirituall food, because they shew vs (as it were to the eye) that the flesh of Iesus Christ is our meate, and his bloud our drinke.

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that some Ministers of the latter times, being Caluines dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, by his example haue induced a subtill method of inuention to speake as we do, saying, that the body of Christ substantially, and not onely in effect, is giuen and vnited to the faithfull in the Supper; yet when they are pressed to make answer, whether the body of Christ is locally present in the signes of bread and wine, they say, no, and that it is distant from them, as heauen is from the earth: from whence ensueth manifest contradiction, and the abuse is disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by this Syllogisme.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>It is impossible that two substances distant one from the other as heauen from the earth, should be entirely and substantially conioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned one with the other.</hi>

                  <p>If I would simply follow the steps of this Doctor, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent my selfe to confute him, this worke would be very slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and of small instruction. For therein he neither compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:11462:254"/> our beleefe nor his owne, and doth as much contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict his owne as our Church, and obserueth neither order, consequence, nor sence in his discourse.</p>
                  <p>He maketh vs say that we exclude the truth of the body of Christ, and are content with the figure onely, which is cleane contrary to that which we beleeue. While the signes are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent before our eyes, and in our mouthes, Iesus Christ is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to our saith, and really giuen to our soules, by a contract made, as by a Kings letters pattents an house or an inheritance may be really giuen vnto vs, although it be farre from vs. The Sunne ioyneth really with our sight, although it be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and we here on earth. The head is really ioyned with the feete by meanes of the soule, which maketh them to be all of one body, although their positure in the body be far asunder. The husband is really one body and one flesh with his wife, although they be absent one from the other. If reall and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiall vnions are found to be in naturall things distant by place one from another, how much more in diuine things? Cannot Iesus Christ really ioyne himselfe to our soules, and by our soules to our bodies, by the meanes of his Spirit dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in our bodies? Cannot he come to vs, without suffering himselfe to be deuoured by his enemies, gnawed with mens teeth, and to be inclosed in a wafer, which may be carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by a beast? The Scripture saith, that we are one body with Iesus Christ, and that he is the head, and we the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; which vnion I thinke our aduersaries will not call ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarie and figuratiue; they rather acknowledge it to be reall and true: and yet this vnion is as well without the Eucharist, as in the Eucharist. For they are constrained to hold the words, although they are ignorant of the thing it selfe, and striue against the fruite and vertue thereof: and with carnall spirits cannot conceiue any other reall vnion with the body of Iesus Christ, then that which is made by eating, as if Iesus Christ were made for the belly, and not for the consciences of men: or as if it were not a priuiledge giuen to the children of God to be really conioyned with the Sonne of God: for they make the wicked and hypocrites also to eate Iesus Christ,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:11462:254"/> and really to participate his body; thinking that the dead can eate the bread of life, and that the enemies of God can be really ioyned with the Sonne of God: esteeming the reall eating with the mouth, to be a much more excellent thing then that which is done by faith. Although the eating by the mouth, is common both to the good and to the bad, but that which is by faith, is proper to the faithfull. And eating with the mouth (without eating by faith) is hurtfull and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to condemnation; but eating by faith is alwaies spirituall and necessary to saluation.</p>
                  <p>Some grosly subtill spirits mocke at the spirituall vnion of Iesus Christ with vs, as if it were a meere imagination, and say, that by the same reason the Spirit of Christ should be substantially vnited with all creatures, because he is in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Which they speake without reason, for although the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God is in euery place, and in all creatures, yet he is not vnited with euery one of thē. There is nothing but the soule that is capable of that vnion. As in naturall formes, it is one thing to assist, another thing to giue forme or shape; so in the Spirit of Christ, it is one thing to be present with any thing, and another thing to vnite it selfe thereunto, to quicken and to sanctifie it. <hi>But he that is ioyned vnto the Lord,</hi> (saith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, 1. Cor. 6.17.) <hi>is made one spirit with him.</hi> So by the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Spirit of Iesus Christ with our spirits, his body al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is made one body with ours, as when the two extreame linkes of a chaine, are ioyned together by a third.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> argues no better when he maketh vs to say, that in the Supper the body of Iesus Christ is giuen in substance, and not onely by effect; as if to giue Iesus Christ in substance, and to giue him effectually, were not all one thing. He spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth as if I should say, that such a man was not onely behea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but also that he had his head cut off.</p>
                  <p>It likewise appeareth, that he vnderstandeth not his owne beleefe, when he disliketh that we beleeue not that Iesus Christ is locally present in the signes of bread and wine: for the Church of Rome doth not beleeue it no more then we.</p>
                  <pb n="466" facs="tcp:11462:255"/>
                  <p>The Syllogisme which he frameth is not a Syllogisme, for the conclusion is composed of diuers peeces which are not found in the premises. In neither of the propositions is there a word of the body of those that receiue the signes. Now nothing ought to be in the conclusion which is not found in the premises.</p>
                  <p>It is one thing to speake of the vnion of the body of Iesus Christ with the signes, and another thing to speake of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the body of Iesus Christ with our soules, and by our soules to our bodies. The signes are ioyned with Iesus Christ by sacramentall vnion, as the water in Baptisme is ioyned with the bloud of Iesus Christ. But the body of Iesus Christ is vnited to our soules by a reall and spirituall vnion.</p>

                  <p>It is one of the greatest graces which God hath shewed vnto vs, that we are freed from so strange an errour, and that
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:11462:257"/> in our Churches they speake not of making of God by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine words, nor of adoring Iesus Christ made by mens hands: as also that we beleeue in one Iesus Christ, which is very man, and hath a true humane body, and who by this meanes is our brother, by his conformitie with our nature, and by the vnion of his Spirit, who being ascended vp into heauen, will come againe vnto vs the second time, at the latter day.</p>
                  <p>Touching the holy Supper, we beleeue with the Apostle, 1. Cor. 11.26. <hi>That we eate bread to shew forth the death of the Lord Iesus Christ.</hi> And 1. Cor. 10.16. <hi>That the bread which we breake is the communion of the body of Christ.</hi> Which bread is called the body of the Lord, because it is the commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration thereof; as Iesus Christ addeth to expound his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, according to the manner of the holy Scripture, which is, to giue the signes the names of those things which they signifie. Not that we beleeue that those signes are onely bare figures bereft of all truth, but with the Apostle we beleeue, that breaking that bread we communicate the in body of Christ. Those signes are not onely significatiue, but also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitiue of Iesus Christ, and of his benefits. For although Iesus Christ is not inclosed in that bread, yet is he truly made ours if with true faith, and loue of God we participate of this holy Sacrament, and put all our trust and confidence in the death of Iesus Christ. Therefore we do not adore the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but Iesus Christ which is in heauen: taking the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles for an example, who did not adore the host in the holy Supper, as neither Iesus Christ did command them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore it, neither yet vsed they any eleuation.</p>

                  <p>All the words of the Euangelists are true, not onely taken altogether, but seuerally. Then let vs first examine them seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and apart, and after that altogether.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 I say that the Gospell witnesseth, that Iesus Christ <hi>tooke bread, that he blessed it, and that he brake it.</hi> Then seeing that Iesus Christ tooke, and brake bread, how comes it that in the Church of Rome they say, that the Priest doth not breake bread? and that it is no more bread, when the breaking of the Sacrament is made?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Gospell saith, that Iesus Christ <hi>tooke bread, that he brake it, and that he gaue it.</hi> Then it is true that he gaue bread, contrary to the Romish Church which saith, that in the Masse the Priest giueth no bread. And note these words, <hi>That Iesus Christ gaue bread.</hi> Which is not giuen but after consecration; it is bread therefore still after consecration.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 And S. <hi>Matth.</hi> witnesseth, That Iesus Christ tooke bread, that he blessed it, and that he brake it, <hi>and that he gaue it to his disciples, and said, Take, eate, this is my body.</hi> Therefore we must beleeue, that the bread which Iesus Christ brake, &amp; gaue, was his body, &amp; not as the Church of Rome, which beleeueth that
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:11462:258"/> it is no more bread, but onely the body of Iesus Christ, made by the conuersion of bread. He that will not be culpable of changing the words of the Gospell, ought constantly to hold these two truths set downe in the Gospell: the one, that Iesus Christ gaue bread; the other, that that bread which he gaue was his body: and must not do as the Church of Rome doth, which vnder a pretence to lay hold on the second truth, ouerthroweth the first, and imagineth a transsubstantiation whereby the bread is abolished.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 These words alone, <hi>This is my body,</hi> whereon they build their doctrine, cannot beare vp this frame of Transsubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. For they are declaratiue words of that which is, and not effectiue of that which is not: and which presuppose that the same bread was alreadie the body of the Lord, before he pronounced those words.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 And indeed both we and our aduersaries agree, that the bread is made the body of Christ by consecration, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secration is not made by these words <hi>This is my body,</hi> but by prayer and blessing which went before, as the Canon of the Church of Rome acknowledgeth, which beginneth <hi>Corpus,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Corpus &amp; sanguinem Christi dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus illud quod de fructibus terrae acceptū &amp; prece mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca sanctificatū rectè sumimus ad salutem spiritualem in memoriam Dominicae pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionis.</note> in the 2.

And Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. in the 4. booke of the Mysteries of the Masse, cap. 6. saith, That Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ did not consecrate by these words, <hi>This is my bodie:</hi> but that he consecrated by his diuine vertue before he vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red those words. And<note n="*" place="margin">Reade the booke of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitefontium, which in the Preface saith, that <hi>Innocent</hi> and <hi>Catharius</hi> and <hi>Gabriel Biel</hi> and the ancient Fathers are of opinion that consecration is made by prayer.</note> certainly reason confirmeth it: for we must be voyde of sence, if we know not, that to consecrate bread to God, we ought rather to speake to God then to the bread. But our aduersaries had rather go against reason, their owne Popes, and their Decrees, then obey the Gospell, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing consecration in these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> by which the Priest speakes not to God, but to the bread.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Moreouer, no man can denie, that when Iesus Christ said, <hi>This is my body,</hi> but by that word <hi>This,</hi> he vnderstood

Now both we and our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries acknowledge, that when Iesus Christ pronounced the word <hi>this,</hi> he held nothing but bread in his hands. It follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth then that by the word <hi>this,</hi> he vnderstood that bread: and by consequence that these words, <hi>this is my body,</hi> signifie <hi>this bread it my body,</hi> and not <hi>vnder these species is my body.</hi> Nor <hi>this shall be transsubstantiated into my body,</hi> as our aduersaries vnderstand it.<note place="margin">

That which is seene (saith the Canon) is bread and a cup, as our eyes witnesse. But touching the instruction which faith requireth, the bread is the body of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 Sith therefore the sence of these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> is, <hi>This bread is my body,</hi> we must know how this bread can be the body of Iesus Christ. Which he himselfe declareth in all the words that follow, which we will particularly sift and examine.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 Iesus Christ (as the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith) hauing said, <hi>This is my body,</hi> addeth, <hi>Which is broken for you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The bread of the holy Supper must needs be the body of Christ, in the same manner that the body of Christ is broken in the holy Supper. But he is not therein really broken; for it is impossible: onely there he is sacramentally broken: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in like sort, the bread is not really the body of Christ, but sacramentally, and as the signes ordinarily take the names of the things by them signified, in the same manner as in the line following, the cup is called a Testament; as circumcision is called the couenant of God, Gen. 17.9.10. As the paschall Lambe is called the passeouer, Exod. 12.11. and 21.2. and 2. Chro. 30.15. &amp;c. As the Arke is called the Eternall, 2. Sam. 6.2, &amp; Psalme 24. because it was a signe of the fauourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God amongst his people. As the Apostle, 1. Cor. 10.4. saith, that the rocke was Christ, because it was a figure of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. The Scripture is full of such examples: it is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary style thereof, to giue vnto the signes the names of those things which they represent. And reason also alloweth it; for what is more naturall and proper then in sacraments to vse sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:11462:259"/> words, and in an action which is figuratiue, to vse a figure conformable to the action? To the end that by calling the signes by the names of those things which they signifie, we may apprehend the vnion which the signe hath with the thing signified. Because God all at one time representeth the signes vnto our eyes, and the thing signified vnto our faith.</p>
                  <p>To say, that hereby we open a gap vnto heresies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fauour the Marcionites, who in like manner might figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely interpret these words of Saint <hi>Iohn, The word was made flesh,</hi> is nothing to the purpose; for Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in that place, speaketh not of a Sacrament: and therefore the sacramentall manner of speaking agrees not to that place. This imputation may iustly be layd vpon our aduersaries themselues, who to establish their Transsubstantiation, wrest and wring all the words of the institution of the Eucharist, and therein induce a dozen vnaccustomed and prodigious figures, as hereafter we shall see.</p>
                  <p>Then to returne to these words, <hi>Which is broken for you,</hi> we must vnderstand that the Romish Churches translation, and the text of the Masse, haue corrupted this place, and haue translated that in the future tense which Iesus Christ spake in the present tense, and haue put <hi>shall be broken,</hi> for <hi>is broken, frangetur,</hi> for <hi>frangitur:</hi> which translation although it be good touching faith, yet it hindreth men from knowing that the purpose of Iesus Christ is sacramentall, and that the name of the thing signified is attributed to the signe.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 Then to make the truth manifest, we aske our aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, whether the body of Iesus Christ be really broken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to peeces in the Eucharist? or whether therein it be onely broken sacramentally, and significantly in a mysterie? If they say it is broken sacramentally, then they are bound to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret these words in the same manner, <hi>This is my body,</hi> and to say, that that which Iesus Christ gaue to his Disciples was his sacramentall body, and a remembrance of him. But if they will haue the body of our Lord to be really bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Masse, thereby they fall into three inconueniences: The first is, that they wrong Iesus Christ, who being impassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:11462:259"/> can no more be broken. The second is, that they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict their Masse and their Bible, which hath translated, <hi>shall be broken,</hi> in the future tense, because there is no other reall breaking of the body of our Lord, but that which was to be done the next day vpon the crosse. The third is, that they contradict themselues: for the Church of Rome beleeueth, that the body of Iesus Christ cannot be broken, and that when the Priest breaketh the host, there is nothing but the accidents that are broken, and that the body of our Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth whole in euery peece thereof. So that it is a mocke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie for them to say, that the body of our Lord is broken vnder the <hi>species,</hi> seeing they say that he remaineth whole vnder the <hi>species.</hi> That which remaineth whole vnder the <hi>species,</hi> is not broken vnder the <hi>species.</hi> Whereby they speake as wisely, as if I should say, that a sword is broken in the scabbard, when the scabbard onely is broken, and the sword is whole and not broken.</p>
                  <p>Herein they ought to giue glory vnto God, and yeeld to the force of truth, and acknowledge, that seeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he body of Christ cannot be really broken in the Sacrament, that therein it is broken sacramentally, in the same manner that the bread is the body of Christ. This breaking hath relation to that vpon the crosse, and taketh the name of that which it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 I say the same of the words which Saint <hi>Luke</hi> vseth, <hi>This is my body which is giuen for you.</hi> For Iesus Christ did not say, <hi>This is my body which I giue you to eate:</hi> but said, <hi>This is my body which is giuen for you.</hi> Which words, <hi>for you,</hi> are as much as, <hi>for your redemption;</hi> which was really done vpon the crosse, but is sacramentally done in the Supper, and for a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, as Iesus Christ addeth, saying, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These words decide the question. For if that which Iesus Christ giueth be the remembrance of Iesus Christ, it is not Iesus Christ: nothing is the remembrance of it selfe. And there is nothing so absurd, as that which our aduersaries say,<note n="*" place="margin">Bell. lib. <hi>2.</hi> de Euchar. ca. <hi>24.</hi> Idem igi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur Christus fuit figura sui-ipsius.</note> that in the Eucharist Iesus Christ is the figure and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:11462:260"/> of himselfe; as if one should say, that the king is his picture, and that he is the image of himselfe. It is to no purpose to alledge diuerse respects, and to say, that Iesus Christ in the Masse is the figure of Iesus Christ on the crosse. For whatsoeuer diuersitie of respects may be alledged, yet the king sitting at the table shall neuer be the figure of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe on horsebacke. And if the king himselfe should repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent one of his battels, yet he should not be the figure of himselfe, but his present action should be a figure of his action past. Adde hereunto, that visible things may be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of inuisible things. But here they will haue Iesus Christ (inuisible in the Masse) to be the figure of Iesus Christ on the crosse, where he was visible.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 Beside, remembrance is of things past or absent, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> saith in his first<note n="*" place="margin">

So when the ancient Fathers called the tombes of Martyrs, remembrances, they shewed thereby, that those Martyrs were in heauen. And the Manna that was kept in the Arke, was not a remembrance of that portion of manna that was in the Arke, but of the miraculous feeding of the people in the desert. And whosoeuer extolleth the valour of a king in his owne presence, doth not renew the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the kings person that is present, but of his actions past, So to haue a remembrance of God, is to remember his maruellous workes, his promises, or his commandements. The same is to be found in all other examples.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be denied, that the holy Supper is a commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration not onely of the person of Iesus Christ; but also of his death, seeing that the Apostle commandeth vs to eate that bread, to shew forth his death. 1. Cor. 11.26. and Iesus Christ saith, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then we haue the exposition of these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> giuen vs by Iesus Christ himselfe, that is, that <hi>the bread which he gaue was the remembrance of his body.</hi>

                  <p n="12">12 Whereupon it is necessarie to set downe something, whereby to stop the mouthes of those that haue their spirits hardened, and are most resolute to contradict the truth. Then
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:11462:260"/> it is to be vnderstood, that the language of the Iewes in the old Testament was the Hebrew tongue, which was still cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Hebrew tongue although it fell from the purity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by mixing it with the Syrian tongue. In this Hebrew tongue, the word <hi>signifie</hi> or <hi>represent</hi> is not found: but the ancient Hebrew Testament in stead of <hi>signifie</hi> alwaies vseth the word <hi>is.</hi> So <hi>Ioseph</hi> in Genesis 40.12. interpreting the dreames of <hi>Pharoes</hi> cup-bearer and of his baker, saith, The three branches of the vine are three dayes; and in the 18. verse, The three baskets are three dayes, that is signifie three dayes: and in the 41. chapter verse 16. <hi>The seuen fat kine are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen yeares, and the seuen full eares of corne are seuen yeares. And the seuen leane euill-fauored kine which came vp after the other, are seuen yeares: and the seuen emptie eares of corne blasted with the east winde, are seuen yeares of famine.</hi> And in foure places of that chapter the word <hi>are</hi> is put for <hi>signifie</hi> or <hi>represent.</hi> So in Ezechiel 37.11. <hi>These bones are the whole house of Israel:</hi> to shew, that it was represented and figured by those bones. And <hi>Daniel</hi> 2.38. <hi>It is thou ô King that art this head of gold,</hi> in stead of saying, It is thou that art signified and prefigured by the head of gold. And 4.20.22, <hi>The tree which thou sawest is thou ô King.</hi> And 7.17. <hi>These foure great beasts, are foure kings.</hi> And 24. verse, <hi>The ten hornes are ten kings.</hi> And in the 8. chap. 20, and 21 verses, <hi>The ram which thou sawest hauing two hornes, are the Kings of Media and Persia: and the rough goate is the king of Graecia.</hi> In all these places and many others, the word <hi>are</hi> is as much as to <hi>signifie</hi> or <hi>represent.</hi> From thence it comes, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Greeke tongue wanteth no words to say, <hi>signifie, figure or represent;</hi> yet the new Testament in Greeke, which oftentimes imitateth the Hebrew phrase, ordinarily saith, <hi>is</hi> for <hi>signifieth.</hi> So the Apostle 1. Cor. 10.4. speaking of the rocke from whence water issued forth in the desert, saith, that <hi>the rocke was Christ.</hi> And Galat. 4.22.24. it is said that the bond seruant and the free, that is, <hi>Agar</hi> and <hi>Sara,</hi> are the two couenants: and Apocal. 17.9.18. <hi>The seuen heads are seuen mountaines whereupon the woman sitteth, and the woman which thou sawest is that great citie.</hi>

                  <p>Then because Iesus Christ could not in his language, say, <hi>This signifieth or representeth my body,</hi> because those words are not in the Hebrew tongue, he spake as the same language led him, and followed the manner of speaking vsed among the Iewes, and continued in the holy Scripture. But foreseeing that Sathan by those words would plant idolatrie in the Church, he added, that that which he did was a remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, which is as much as if he had said, <hi>This is the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of my body.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Luke</hi> that wrote since, setteth downe these words 22.20. in this manner, saying, <hi>This cup is that new Testament in my bloud, which is shed for you.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith the same 1. Cor. 11.25.</p>
                  <p>These two pen-men of the Spirit of God, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> which wrote after the rest, serue for expositors, and make a paraphrase of the words of our Lord rehearsed by Saint <hi>Matthew.</hi> For it is to be presupposed, that he which writeth after another, writeth not to obscure him, but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and make him euident. It were a great abuse to make Iesus Christ to be the expounder of Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words, seeing that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> wrote expresly to expound the words of Iesus Christ, to cause the same to be vnderstood.</p>
                  <p>Our Sauiour Iesus Christ hauing said, that <hi>the cup is his bloud,</hi> the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth vs in what sence that ought to be taken, that is, <hi>This cup is the new Testament,</hi> or <hi>the new couenant in his bloud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These words of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> and of Saint <hi>Paul, This cup is the new Testament,</hi> or <hi>this cup is a new couenant,</hi> (for the Greeke signifieth both the one and the other) leade vs directly to the knowledge of the truth.</p>
                  <p n="14">14 For I demand of our aduersaries, whether that which is
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:11462:261"/> in the cup be a couenant sacramentally and in a significant mysterie, or whether they will haue it to be the Testament &amp; couenant of God in effect. If that which is in the cup be not really the couenant of God, but in a mysticall signification &amp; sacramentally, we must say, that that which Iesus Christ brake and put into his disciples hands, was not really the body of Iesus Christ, but sacramentally, &amp; in a mysticall signification.</p>
                  <p>But if they will haue that which is in the cup really to be a Testament, and the bloud of Iesus Christ (which they pretend to be in the cup) to be a Testament, thereby they say and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that which they themselues beleeue not. 1. For will they haue the wine to be transsubstantiated into a couenant, or to become a Testament? 2. Can they speake more absurdly, then to say, that the bloud of Iesus Christ is a couenant or a testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? For a couenant and a Testament is a relation, or an action, but the bloud of our Lord is a substance 3. A Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment consisteth in clauses and promises, which agreeth not with the bloud of Christ. 4. What an absurditie is it, to call Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ a Testament, seeing he is the testator, or to call him a couenant, seeing the couenant is betweene him &amp; vs? 5. If one of the parties contracting may be called the couenant, the faithful also may be called the couenant, because the couenant is contracted with them. 6. If the bloud of our Lord be the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant and testament, the Priest (as they say) making the bloud of Iesus Christ euery day, maketh the couenant of God, and the Testament of Iesus Christ. But the couenant of God is no more made, it is eternall, and the Testament of the Sonne of God is not reiterable; and to apply the same, we must not make it. 7. Besides, if the bloud of our Lord in the cup be really the new Testament, then it followes, that the new Testament began at that time, which notwithstanding was before. For before the institution of this Sacrament, the Gospell was already preached, which beareth this inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>The new Testament.</hi> And Baptisme also was then already instituted, which is a Sacrament of the new Testament. 8. And Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> saith, that <hi>That which is in the cup is the bloud of the new Testament;</hi> then it followeth, that that bloud is not
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:11462:262"/> the new Testament. For as <hi>Philips</hi> cloake is not <hi>Philip</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, so the bloud of the new Testament is not the new Testament it selfe. And yet our aduersaries fully hardened in errour, obstinately maintaine that the bloud of the Lord which they say is in the cup, is truly and really a couenant, and that the wine is transsubstantiated into a couenant.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit truth is so strong, that it makes them say the truth when they thinke not thereon. For they say, that the cup is called the couenant, because that by the cup the couenant is confirmed, and that it is the seale thereof; which is the same that we say, and by which we proue, that the cup is not the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant really, but the Sacrament thereof: for the confirmation of a thing is not the thing it selfe, and a seale set vpon a letter is not the letter it selfe. So that against their wils they yeeld vnto vs. For seeing that the cup is called the couenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is the seale thereof, by the same reason the bread also must be called the body of Christ, because it is the seale and the confirmation thereof, which is our beleefe. For the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are seales, as Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 4, calleth circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>The seale of the righteousnesse of faith,</hi> although in it there was no transsubstantiation.</p>
                  <p n="16">16 And in saying that the cup is the seale of the couenant, they confesse (against their wils,) that the cup is not really the bloud of Iesus Christ. For the seales and confirmations of a couenant, and the signatures of a Testament, ought to be visible, and exposed vnto our senses: but the bloud in the cup is inuisible. For it is not onely hidden vnder the accidents and apparence of wine, but it is also hidden in the body: for our aduersaries say, that the body is in the cup, and that the bloud which is in the cup, is in the veines of the body, in its naturall places.</p>
                  <p n="17">17 And if these things were not as cleare as the Sunne, yet the words that follow are strong enough to force those that are most obstinate to yeeld, and to make such as are wilfully blind to see the truth. For the Gospell saith, <hi>This cup is the new Testament in my bloud.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These words, <hi>in my bloud,</hi> cleare the point, and manifestly
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:11462:262"/> shew, that that which is in the cup is not really the bloud of Iesus Christ. For say, that by <hi>this cup</hi> we must vnderstand <hi>this bloud,</hi> and let vs see what will ensue thereof. Is not this to make the words of our Lord ridiculous, to make him say, <hi>This bloud is the new Testament in my bloud?</hi> What? is that bloud of Iesus Christ in the bloud of Iesus Christ? Must we by this meanes make two sorts of bloud of Iesus Christ, as<note n="*" place="margin">Bell. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Euchar. cap. <hi>11.</hi> §. Ad quartum. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis accipitur duobus modis in his duobus locis.</note>
                     <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth, for feare of putting the bloud of Iesus Christ into the bloud of Iesus Christ? For it is certaine, that that which is in a thing, whether it be contained therein, whether it be infused therein, or whether it be adherent therein, is not one selfe same thing with that thing. For seeing that the Gospell witnesseth that <hi>Calix est in sanguine Christi,</hi> it saith euidently, that <hi>Calix non est sanguis Christ:</hi> a cup which is in the bloud of Christ, is not really the bloud of Christ, but sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, and by commemoration, as it is added.</p>
                  <p n="18">18 Our aduersaries charged with so many absurdities, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselues by impietie, which casteth them headlong into other absurdities. They say that there is mention made of two sorts of bloud of Iesus Christ, where of the one is a cup, the other was shed vpon the crosse; wherof the one was pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon the other, and whereof the one is the Testament, and the other not. But still it is the same bloud. If these seuerall respects, should make seuerall blouds of Christ, there would be a thousand sorts of bloud, one at the table, another in the ship, and another after the resurrection, &amp;c. And if the bloud in the cup hath the honour to be the couenant, why should we depriue the bloud of the crosse of that honour? Then to effect this, they must forge two sorts of couenants, and by that meanes creep among thornes as snakes do, and couer rhemselues with a thousand wrested deuices against the force of truth.</p>
                  <p n="19">19 Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> addeth, <hi>This bloud,</hi> or as Saint <hi>Luke and</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> say, <hi>This cup is shed for many for the remission of sinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The vnderstanding of these words depends vpon those that went before; for seeing we haue proued that the Lord giueth
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:11462:263"/> to the signes the names of the things signified, it is agreeable to reason, that as the cup is the bloud of Iesus Christ sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, so it should be shed sacramentally. For you must note, that the Euangelists say, <hi>is shed,</hi> and speake in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent tense, saying <hi>effunditur,</hi> and not <hi>effundetur,</hi> as the Masse and the Romish translation say. For although that this sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall shedding of the bloud of Christ for the remission of sinnes, hath relation to the effusion vpon the crosse, yet we ought to translate the words faithfully. Also the translation in the present tense doth hinder vs from knowing that our Sauiours intent was sacramentall, and that the name of the thing signified is attributed to the signe.</p>
                  <p n="20">20 Herein our Aduersaries are much troubled. For if this shedding be sacramentall and a commemoration, we haue wonne our cause: and the Doctors of the Romish Church are on our side, who hauing glossed vpon the Decretall in the 2. Distinction of Consecration, say, <hi>Sanguis effunditur, id est, effundi significatur,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cant. <hi>5.</hi> Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiescunque.</note> The bloud is shed, that is, it is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or represented that the bloud is shed. The Masse it selfe also, translating in the future tense <hi>effundetur,</hi> shall be shed, leadeth vs the right way, to giue vs to vnderstand, that the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion in the Sacrament was a signification and representation of the effusion the next day vpon the Crosse.</p>
                  <p n="21">21 Yet our Aduersaries contend with vs herein, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that the bloud of Iesus Christ is really and effectually shed in the Eucharist. But if you aske them, whether in the Eucharist the bloud issueth out of the body, or out of the veines; they say, no, and so contradict themselues, and confesse that the bloud is not really shed. They themselues call the Eucharist a Sacrifice without bloud; which should be false if therein bloud were really shed. They also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict themselues when they say, that the bloud of our Lord stirreth not in the Eucharist, nor moueth, and yet it is shed therein, for all shedding is a mouing.</p>
                  <p n="22">22 In this perplexitie their onely refuge is, neuer to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer any thing to the purpose. For being asked, whether
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:11462:263"/> the bloud of our Lord is shed in the Masse, they say it is shed vnder the <hi>species.</hi> But we aske them not, vnder what thing the bloud is shed, but whether it be shed therein, or no. Adde hereunto, that the bloud which cometh not out of the bodie vnder the <hi>species,</hi> and which stirreth not from vnder the <hi>species,</hi> is not shed vnder the <hi>species.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="23">23 They say, that the accidents which they call <hi>species,</hi> are shed, which is a capricious kinde of Philosophie, to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the Priest powreth our lines, taste, and colour of wine without wine, and that the bloud is shed without is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing out of the body. So that the Priest filleth out, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, bones, flesh, and a liquid and potable humane bodie, which is whole in euery drop of the wine.</p>
                  <p n="24">24 The Lord concludeth his intent by a clause which defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiuely decideth the controuersie, saying, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.29. <hi>I say vnto you, I will not drinke henceforth of this fruit of the Vine.</hi> Saint <hi>Marke</hi> saith the like. Our Lord could not more plainly say that it was the fruit of the Vine which he dranke, and not bloud. For the fruit of the vine and wine are all one thing. It is true that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> speaketh of two cuppes, one of the paschall Lambe, the other of the holy Supper, and witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth also, that Iesus Christ called the cuppe of the paschall Lambe the fruit of the Vine. But Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and Saint <hi>Marke</hi> speake onely of the cup of the Eucharist, which they call the fruit of the Vine. It cannot be said, that they call that wine in the Cup the fruit of the Vine, of which they speake not at all. Then to make the Euangelists to agree, we must necessarily say, that Iesus Christ spake twise of the fruit of the Vine, and that administring the cup of the Eucharist, he vsed the same termes.<note place="margin">Quod autem vinum in san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crauit patet ex eo quod ipse subiunxit, non bibam à modo de genimine, &amp;c.</note> For it were an intollerable boldnes to correct Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> and Saint <hi>Marke</hi> by Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> and to charge them to haue troubled the order and method of our Sauiours words in so important an action, whereat Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> himselfe was present. Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, in the fourth booke of the mysteries of the Masse, 27. chapter, acknowledgeth, that Iesus Christ called that the fruit of the Vine which he consecrated in the Cup.</p>
                  <pb n="484" facs="tcp:11462:264"/>
                  <p>Being put from that, they haue another refuge, and say, that the wine is called the fruit of the Vine, in regard that it was so before. As if we should call a man of fiftie yeares of age, a childe, because once he was a childe: and ripe grapes veriuice, because they haue bene so. This is to say that a thing is that which it is not. The examples by them alled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of <hi>Moses</hi> Rod, that was called a Rod after it was chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into a Serpent; and of the water, called water after it was changed into wine, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.9. are to no purpose. For that Serpent had bene a Rod, and that wine had bene water; but the bloud of Christ neuer was wine. And that Rod was tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into a Serpent, which it was not before. But here they will haue this wine to be turned into bloud, which was so al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready before the conuersion. Adde hereunto, that such a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure is repugnant to the nature of a Sacrament, which requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that the name of the thing signified should be giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the signe, and not that the name of the signe should be giuen to the thing signified. When we call the wine, bloud, we speake according to the custome and nature of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but when we call the bloud of our Lord wine, or the fruit of the Vine, we ouerthrow the nature of the Sacrament, and embase the thing signified; and to shun a naturall and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall figure in these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> induce a figure against nature, which is not vsuall, in these words, <hi>I will drinke no more of this fruit of the wine.</hi>

For, as Iesus Christ made no lifting vp of the hoast, so he did not command the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles to worship that which he held in his hands; and it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that they sate at the Table, which is an vnfit action for those that adore. For if at this day any one should do as the Apostles then did, he should be held among them to be a
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:11462:264"/> prophane fellow, and a contemner of God. It is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to say, that the Apostles had Iesus Christ daily with them: for they did neuer eate him, nor swallowed him downe into their stomacks, nor euer were present at such a sacrifice. And such an adoration had bene necessarie in the first institution of that Sacrament, and in an action which was to serue for a patterne and president in time to come.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The time also when the Lord celebrated that action, is very necessarie to be considered. For then his body was weake and passible, but the body which they will haue Iesus Christ to haue giuen to his Disciples, was impassible, and could not be broken, as being whole in euery crumme, and spirituall and indiuisible. There shall neuer any example be found, wherein a body is weake, and passible in one place, and elsewhere impassible and without infirmitie. Contrarie things may agree in one selfe same subiect at seuerall times, or in seuerall parts of the subiect, or in diuers respects, that is, being compared to diuers things: As for example a man may be white to day, and the next day blacke; he may be white in one part of his body, and blacke in another; he may be rich in comparison to one that is poorer, and poore in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison to one that is richer. But that at one selfe same time, a man being whole, and not compared to another, can be white and blacke, or poore and rich, it is impossible. This is it which they do to the body of Christ, when they make it to be whole, and at the same time, without comparing it to another body, make it mortall and immortall, passible and impassible, weake and without infirmitie, visible and inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, speaking, and mouing it selfe at the Table, and not speaking nor being able to moue vnder the <hi>species</hi> of bread. Thus you haue two contrary Iesus Christs, and one of them more perfect then the other: for, to be impassible, is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and to be passible is an imperfection.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 They agree with vs, that Iesus Christ in the Eucharist did eate and drinke with his disciples; then it followeth, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the doctrine of the Church of Rome) that Iesus Christ did eate himselfe, and that he swallowed his whole bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:11462:265"/> downe into his stomacke. And seeing that naturally Iesus Christs mouth stood in his head, by this doctrine we must say, that at one selfe same time he had his mouth in his head, and his head in his mouth. And yet he did not eate himselfe as he was, for when Iesus Christ did eate, he was weake, and Iesus Christ eaten by Iesus Christ was without infirmitie. Which being a greater miracle then the conception and the resurrection of Iesus Christ, yet they can produce no fruite thereby, nor shew vs how that can profit vs touching our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. And if Iesus Christ did that to serue for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Priest, then it followeth that the Priest should eate himselfe in the Masse. And it is hard to say, what the body of Iesus Christ did in the body of Iesus Christ, and what effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie it had therein. And seeing that they say, that the soule is within the host, to what end should Christs soule enter into Christ, seeing it was there already? Do our aduersaries thinke to be beleeued in all these things? Is not this the way to paint the house of God with <hi>Chimaeraes,</hi> and to expose religion to open obloquy?</p>
                  <p n="4">4 It is also to be noted; that our aduersaries hold, with S. <hi>Augustine</hi> and Saint <hi>Hierome,</hi> that <hi>Iudas</hi> receiued the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist with the rest of the Apostles. And indeed Saint <hi>Luke</hi> after the administration of the Sacrament, witnesseth that Iesus Christ said, <hi>Behold the hand of him that betrayeth me is with me at the table.</hi> But it is manifest, that the body of Iesus Christ did not enter into <hi>Iudas:</hi> for the Gospell witnesseth that <hi>Iudas</hi> being at the table, the diuell entred into him. Iesus Christ and the diuell could not well haue lodged both in one place: for then the diuell preuailed in <hi>Iudas,</hi> and so it must follow, that the diuell got the vpper hand of Iesus Christ. But Iesus Christ dwelleth not in any man, without producing the effects of saluation in him. <hi>Whosoeuer eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud hath life eternall,</hi> Iohn 6.54.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 It is a notable circumstance to be considered, that Iesus Christ celebrating the Eucharist was troubled, as now entring into his passion; and when he arose from the table, he said that his soule was very heauy, euen vnto the death, and swet drops
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:11462:265"/> of bloud for griefe. And yet at one selfe same time our aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries make one Iesus Christ to be in the mouthes and sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mackes of the Apostles, which being impassible, suffered no paine nor griefe, neither sweat drops of bloud; which not onely makes two contrary Iesus Christs at one time, but also one Iesus Christ which is not our Sauiour, seeing he is exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from passions.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Lastly, it is to be thought, that the bread being broken in so many peeces among the Apostles, some crums or small peeces thereof did fall downe, and that there was some of it left; yet Iesus Christ did not command them to take them vp, nor to reserue the rest, which he would haue done, if euery crum &amp; peece thereof had bene Iesus Christs body fully and wholly.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 But say that there was no bread remaining, yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles in the meane time that Iesus Christ was vpon the crosse, or in the sepulcher, might among themselues celebrate the Sacrament: and so there should be one Iesus Christ vpon the crosse, with his hands and feete pierced with nayles and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and another not on the crosse, that had not his hands and his feete pierced, neither suffered any torment. And if in the host Iesus Christ is also crucified and whipt, then they must put the crosse, and the executioners, and the whips into the host, or else they must say that he was crucified vnder the host without the crosse, and whipped without whips, which are apparent contradictions.</p>

                  <p n="1">1 The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 11.26. hauing declared the institution of the holy Supper, addeth: <hi>For as often as ye
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:11462:266"/> eate this bread and drinke this cup, ye do shew the Lords death till he comes. Wherefore whosoeuer shall eate this bread, and drinke this cup of the Lord vnworthily, shall be guiltie of the body and bloud of the Lord. But let a man examine himselfe, and so let him eate of that bread, and drinke of that cup.</hi> This excellent Apostle three times in this one place saith, that we eate bread, and it is not eaten but after consecration. This sheweth then that that which Iesus Christ said to be his body, was still bread in that sence, and for the reasons aforesaid.</p>
                  <p>Then I aske our aduersaries, if when the Apostle three times in one place saith, that we eate bread, whether the word bread ought to be taken properly and without a figure, or whether it ought to be taken figuratiuely for the body of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ. If it be taken properly, we are satisfied, and so it is bread still after consecration. But if they will affirme that S. <hi>Paul</hi> three times together spake figuratiuely, and that we must expound the figuratiue words of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> by Iesus Christs words <hi>this is my body;</hi> therein they manifestly discouer their vnfaithfull dealing. For they know that Iesus Christ is not an expounder of the Apostles words, but that the Apostles are expositors of Iesus Christs words. And who ought to speake more clearely, either he that is expounded or he that expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth? He that spake first and briefly, or he that speaketh after him and more at large? Specially considering we see that Iesus Christ saying, <hi>This is my body,</hi> did sufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound himselfe; but Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saying three times one after another, that we eate bread, addeth no exposition. And if by this word <hi>bread</hi> so many times rehearsed by the Apostle we must vnderstand flesh, should not the same Apostle be culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of holding the people in an error, and of digging a ditch to make them to fall into it? seeing he knew that sense and reason witnesse that it is bread, whose reports men naturally beleeue?</p>
                  <p>But seeing that our aduersaries turne all things into figures, let vs see how they expound those figures: they will haue the body of our Lord to be called bread, because it was bread be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore consecration. Which is false, for Christs body neuer was
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:11462:266"/> bread. Besides, it is more conuenient to call things by those names which they are, then by those things which they are not any more. And if there be a place or two in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where that is vsed, there are thousands that call things that which they are, and not that which they haue bene. 2. Also they say, that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that <hi>we eate bread</hi> in stead of saying, that we eate the body of Christ, because it seemeth to be bread. That also is false, for the body of our Lord neuer seemed to be bread. It is true, that our aduersaries say that the body of our Lord is couered ouer with the <hi>species</hi> of bread, but men neuer giue things that are couered, the names of those things which couer them; we call not a scab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard a sword, we neuer say that a man is a chest although he should be hidden in a Chest.</p>
                  <p>Notwithstanding the extenuating of this sacred bread, redoundeth to the dishonour of Iesus Christ; as when men treade the kings great seale vnder their feete, the king, &amp; not the waxe is dishonoured thereby: so to prophane this bread, is to prophane the Sonne of God; therefore he which recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it vnworthily, receiueth his owne condemnation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he discerneth not the body of our Lord. They would make the Apostle to say, that such an one doth not discerne that it is the body of our Lord which he hath eaten: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the sence of the Apostles words are, that such an one doth not discerne the body of our Lord, which he hath wronged and dishonored.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In Acts. 2.46. it is said, that the disciples <hi>did breake bread from house to house;</hi> and Acts 20.7. <hi>When the disciples came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to breake bread.</hi> Which place our aduersaries confesse, is meant of the Sacrament of the Eucharist. They therefore who denie that they did there breake bread, will be wiser then the Apostles, and condemne the words of the Spirit of God, which at this day would be ridiculous. For which of our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries would endure a Priest, that in stead of saying, I go to sing Masse, should say, I go to brake bread? Here also our aduersaries find another figure, and by the word bread, will haue vs to vnderstand flesh.</p>

                  <p n="3">3 In 1. Corinthians 10.16. the Apostle saith, <hi>The bread which we breake is it not the cōmunion of the body of Christ?</hi> Adde hereunto, that he saith that we breake bread: and it appeareth that by bread he vnderstandeth true bread, and not the body of Christ, because he saith the bread is broken. The body of Christ cannot be broken, it is not broken vnder the <hi>species,</hi> if it remaineth whole vnder the <hi>species.</hi> Besides he saith, that this bread is the communion of the body of Christ; but the body of Christ is not the communion of the body of Christ. It must then be bread: and when we breake that bread we participate in the body of Christ, vnlesse we will giue the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle the lye thrice in one line, by saying, that it is no bread, but flesh; that the flesh is not broken, and that it is not the communion of the body of Christ, but the body of Christ it selfe.

                  <p n="5">5 Iesus Christ, in Saint Iohn 17.11. being ready to leaue the world to go vnto his Father, speaketh as being already departed out of the world, saying, <hi>And now I am no more in the world.</hi> And 16.18. <hi>I leaue the world and go to my Father.</hi> And 12.8. <hi>For the poore alwayes ye haue with you, but me ye haue not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes.</hi> And 13.1. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>When Iesus knew that his houre was come that he should depart out of this world vnto the Father.</hi> Here Iesus Christ declareth that he is no more in the world, that he left the world, and that we should not alwayes haue him with vs. These speeches dislike the Church of Rome, for she will haue vs to haue Iesus Christ alwayes with vs, and that he should now be oftener &amp; more on earth, then he was when
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:11462:267"/> he liued here on earth in his infirmitie: for then he was but in one place at one time, but now they will haue him to be in a thousand places all at one time; and not onely that his body should be here among men, but also in the power of men, who keepe it vnder locke and key, for feare of mice, or lest it should be stolen away.</p>
                  <p>They make answer and say, that in these places Iesus Christ saith that he is not visibly in the world, that he leaueth the world, and that we shall not haue him alwayes, as touching his visible presence. This is a kinde of mockerie. For to haue Iesus Christ inuisibly, is alwayes to haue Iesus Christ, and to be alwayes present inuisiblie, is not to leaue the world. He lieth that saith he hath no money, because his money is hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in his pocket; or he that should say that he hath no soule, because his soule is inuisible. He that is in Paris, and hideth himselfe in a place where no man can see him, cannot there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be said that he is not in Paris.</p>
                  <p>But there is nothing that more euidently confuteth this euasion, then the promise of Iesus Christ made to his Apostles, Iohn 14.15. whereby he promiseth them, that going from them, he would for a recompence, and for their comfort, send them the holy Ghost, whom he calleth the comforter. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely if Iesus Christ is really present vnder the <hi>species</hi> in the holy Supper, our Lord could and would haue comforted them otherwise touching his absence, by saying, You shall no more haue me present touching my visible presence, but I will be really present vnder the bread, in your mouthes and in your stomackes, in such manner that I will be much more present &amp; nearer vnto you, then I was during my visible conuersation here on earth.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 These considerations put vs in minde of the propheticall aduertisement of our Lord Iesus Christ, giuen Mat. 24.24. saying, There shall arise false Prophets and false Christs, who shall shew great signes and wonders, and shall say, behold Christ is here, or he is there, or that he is in the secret cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; whom he forbiddeth vs to beleeue. Then when our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersaries say, there is Christ in the host, or that God goeth
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:11462:268"/> by, or that he is in the pixe, or in a chamber vnder locke and key, and that thereupon men tell vs of miracles, we admire the Propheticall words of the Sonne of God, and adore his iudgements, touching the hardning of mens hearts.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>28</label> Out of all that which is said before, it is an easie matter to set downe a briefe and certaine exposition of these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> drawne out of the most expresse words of the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>The vnderstanding of these words depends vpon the right and true exposition of the word <hi>This,</hi> and of the exposition of the words <hi>my body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the word <hi>This,</hi> it is out of question that Iesus Christ vnderstood that which he brake and gaue to his disciples, and that which he commanded them to eate. The Gospell wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesseth that Iesus Christ brake bread, <hi>He tooke bread, and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it, and brake it.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 10.16. saith: <hi>The bread which he breake.</hi> And Acts 20.7. <hi>Being come together to breake bread.</hi> And the Gospell witnesseth that Iesus Christ gaue bread, <hi>He tooke bread and blessed it, and brake it, and gaue it.</hi> The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> also, 1. Cor. 11. witnesseth that it is bread that we eate, saying, <hi>When you shall eate of this bread.</hi> And againe, <hi>But let a man examine himselfe, and so let him eate of that bread.</hi> Then the sence of the word <hi>This,</hi> is thus; <hi>The bread which I breake, and giue you to eate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And by consequence, these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> are as much to say as, <hi>this bread which I breake, and giue you to eate, is my body.</hi> Which proposition being not true, if it be taken in the literall sence, (seeing that bread is not really and actually the body of Christ) it is certaine that in these words there is a figure.</p>
                  <pb n="493" facs="tcp:11462:268"/>
                  <p>Now to know this figure, we must learne it by the words following, which Iesus Christ addeth, saying, <hi>Do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me.</hi> And by the nature of the present action, which is a Sacrament and a sacred signe, to the which by consequence sacramentall phrases are conuenient. They are called sacramentall phrases when the signe is called by the name of the thing signified, in the same manner that in the line following the cup is called the couenant: because it is a signe and a Sacrament of the couenant. Which is the vsuall manner of speaking in the Scripture, as we haue shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>This then is the exposition of these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> gathered out of the Scripture: <hi>The bread which I breake, and which I giue you to eate, is the remembrance of my body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which exposition whosoeuer reiecteth, gainsayeth all the expresse places of the Scripture as haue bene alledged, and against the nature of a Sacrament; and to shun a simple, natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and an vsuall figure in the Scripture, fit and conuenient for the present action, induceth a multitude of other vnaccusto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med figures, without any example, and contrary to the nature of a Sacrament, as we will shew. And so affirme that Iesus Christ did eate himselfe, that the body of our Lord and the diuell both at one time entred into <hi>Iudas.</hi> And that the Lord had a mortall body which sate at the table with his disciples, and that at the very same time he had a body without infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and impassible in the mouthes and stomackes of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles. Which obstinacie of men resolute in error, God hath punished with so great blindnesse, that they haue proceeded so farre, as that they beleeue that rats or mice can eate the body of our Lord, now when he is in heauen fitting on the right hand of God.</p>

                  <p>Notwithstanding they themselues, to shun this vsuall and naturall figure for the present action, forge a multitude of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accustomed figures, contrary to the nature of the action, and there is not one word found in the Scripture touching this matter, to the which in a manner they giue not a blow, and wherein they do not forge some figure, which diffigureth the sence, and corrupteth the doctrine.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 In these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> they say that by the word <hi>this,</hi> we must vnderstand <hi>vnder these species,</hi> and that <hi>this,</hi> is an <hi>indiuiduum vagum,</hi> which signifieth no certaine thing, but the sence whereof hangeth in suspence vntill such time as the words are fully pronounced.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 They also say, that by the word <hi>is,</hi> we must vnderstand <hi>shall be,</hi> for they say that transsubstantiation is not done till the words are pronounced.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 In these words, <hi>He tooke the cup,</hi> saying, <hi>This cup is the new couenant,</hi> they say that the word cup, is a word of two sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications, and that at the first, the word cup signifieth the wine, and in the second place it signifieth the bloud.</p>
                  <pb n="495" facs="tcp:11462:269"/>
                  <p n="4">4 So, when Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> saith, <hi>This is my bloud, the bloud of the new Testament,</hi> by the word <hi>Testament,</hi> they vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the couenant of God. But when Saint <hi>Luke</hi> and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> say, <hi>This cup is the new Testament in my bloud,</hi> they will haue the Testament to be Iesus Christ himselfe, and that the Testament and the testator should be all one.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 In these words, <hi>This cup is the new Testament in my bloud,</hi> they will haue vs by the cup to vnderstand the bloud of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ in the Eucharist, and that by the words <hi>my bloud,</hi> we must vnderstand the bloud shed vpon the crosse, making another bloud of Iesus Christ to be powred into the bloud of Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 And when Christ calleth that which he dranke the fruite of the vine, they say, that by the fruite of the vine we must vnderstand the bloud, because it was wine before the conuersion, or because it hath an apparence thereof.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 For the same reasons, when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> three times one after the other saith, that we eate bread, they will haue the word bread to signifie the body of Christ.</p>
                  <p n="8">8 And when Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>The bread that we breake is the communion of the body of Christ,</hi> they say, that by the bread we must vnderstand the body, and denie that the bread is broken, because the body (as they say) remaineth whole in euery peece of the host.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 So when Iesus Christ so many times declareth, that he leaueth the world, and that he will be no more in the world, they adde, <hi>visibly,</hi> and so by the addition of one word, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and peruert the meaning of many places of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 And when the Lord, Ioh. 6.51. saith, <hi>That if any man eateth his flesh, he shall liue for euer;</hi> they plainly perceiue, that if in those words Iesus Christ speaketh of the participation of the Sacrament, it must of force follow, that <hi>Iudas</hi> and diuerse hypocrites which did, and do participate therein, shall liue for euer: which to auoide, they adde to the Lords words, and say, that his meaning is, that if a man eateth the flesh of the Lord worthily, he shall liue for euer. But we maintaine that
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:11462:270"/> a man cannot eate the flesh of the Lord vnworthily, seeing that it cannot be eaten but onely spiritually and in faith; which cannot be done vnworthily.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.</note> It is true that the Scripture speaketh of eating the bread vnworthily, but not of eating the flesh of our Lord vnworthily.</p>
                  <p n="11">11 So, when in the 53. verse the Lord saith, <hi>Except ye eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, ye haue no life in you;</hi> they plainly see, that if there it is spoken of the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, the good theefe, and many faithfull persons, which died, and die without hauing meanes of participating therin, shall be excluded from euerlasting life. Therefore they adde another peece to the word, and tell vs, that Iesus Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent was to say, <hi>If you eate not my flesh, when you haue meanes to do it, ye shall not haue life eternall.</hi> But the sentence of our Lord is true, simply and without exception. For whosoeuer eateth not the flesh of our Lord in faith, hath not life eternall.</p>
                  <p n="12">12 And when our Lord saith, <hi>If you drinke not my bloud, you shall not haue life eternall:</hi> that they may not by this sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be bound to minister the cup to the people, they say, that by the word <hi>drinke,</hi> the Lord vnderstood <hi>to take it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out drinking,</hi> because the bloud also is in the host.</p>
                  <p>Now where are these men that are so great enemies to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, and which sticke so fast and scrupulously to the letter? But therein they thinke they haue a priuiledge: for they say that the Church of Rome cannot erre in her interpretations:<note n="*" place="margin">Tit. <hi>8.</hi> De concess.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>30</label> The worst mischiefe is, that by this doctrine the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Iesus Christ is abolished, and the dignity of Priests ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, contrary to the honour of the Sonne of God. This of all others is a principall heresie. For to ouerthrow the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature of Iesus Christ, is to cut the band in twaine which vniteth vs to God, and a stopping of the pipe whereby God maketh his celestiall benefits to fall downe vpon vs. God doth not acknowledge vs to be his children, but onely because we are brerhren to his Sonne. But we should not be brethren to the Sonne of God, if he were not a man as we are, and had not an humane nature like vnto ours. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to participate with our humane nature, that we might be partakers of his diuine nature, &amp; to put on our flesh, to clothe vs with his Spirit. That is it which the Apostle Hebrewes 2.17. saith, <hi>Wherefore in all things it behoued him to be made like vnto his brethren.</hi> And 4.15. he saith, <hi>He was in all points temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted like as we are, yet without sinne:</hi> That he might be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, and that hauing a brother which is inheritor of the kingdome of heauen, we might be coheires with him by vertue of that alliance.</p>
                  <p>This doctrine of Transsustantiation striketh piety at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry root, and wounds religion at the heart.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For Iesus Christ hath not a true humane body, if the parts of his body be not different in situation, and if in euery part of the host his body be whole, so that his head and his feet are in the whole host, and his head and his feete in euery par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part thereof.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 To take from a body those things whereby it differeth from a spirit, is to make it no more a body but a spirit. But by transsubstantiation the body of our Lord is bereft of all the
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:11462:271"/> properties and differences whereby a body is distinguished from a spirit. For vnder the <hi>species</hi> they make it to be without space, and without circumscription, hauing no place, no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, nor space, nor parts or members situated apart in their places.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 And as in a point there is neither length nor breadth, whosoeuer placeth an humane body all whole vnder an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible point, bereaueth it of all length and breadth, and by consequent maketh it to be no more a body.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 In the Eucharist they make the body of our Lord to be more spirituall then the soules. For a soule is but in one place, it is neuer separated from it selfe, as they say the Lords body is, which is whole in heauen, and whole in an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand places all at one time here on earth, and is not in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion betweene both.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 Also euery humane body hath his interior parts situated in their naturall places, as the heart inclosed in the heart-case, the braine that filleth the membranes and the inner hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lownesse of the head. If that be not in Iesus Christ, he is no man. Then seeing it is manifest that the interior parts of the body of Iesus Christ occupie a space, and are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by the place, which is the interior superficies of the body which containeth them: is it not a contradiction vnto themselues to say, that the seuerall parts of the body of Christ do fill a space, and are contained in a place, but that all the body doth not fill any space, neither is contained in any place? As if one should say, that euery seuerall part of a body is white, and that the whole body is blacke.</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Againe, by transsubstantiation they make and produce a body, which was a body before they make it. For the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Iesus Christ which is already in heauen, is made by the Priest here on earth: as if while <hi>M. Arnour</hi> is at Paris, he should be begotten in Rome.</p>
                  <p n="7">7 We haue shewed before that this doctrine giues Iesus Christ two contrary bodies at one time, one body sitting at the table, the other in the mouthes of the Apostles, which sate not at the table: one body speaking and mouing, the other
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:11462:271"/> not speaking, nor able to stirre it selfe. One a weake and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble body, the other without infirmitie and impassible. One body which suffered and sweat drops of bloud, the other in the stomackes of the Apostles, which suffered no paine: which of these is our redeemer?</p>
                  <p n="8">8 And when they say that the consecrated host is round, what meane they by the host? Do they vnderstand Iesus Christ? Iesus Christ is not round. Or do they vnderstand the accidents? Those accidents are not the host. In this matter they can hardly speake three words without contradicting themselues.</p>
                  <p n="9">9 It serues not their turnes to giue the body of Christ two beings, the one natural, the other sacramentall. For besides that one thing can haue but one being; and to giue Iesus Christ a sacramētall being, that is to say, significatiue, is to build castles in the aire: our aduersaries confesse, that vnder the <hi>species</hi> Iesus Christ hath also his naturall being. Whereby it followeth, that also in that naturall being which is vnder the <hi>species,</hi> these things must happen vnto it, to be in no place, to haue no space, to haue his length vnder a point, and such like things disagreeing with a true body.</p>
                  <p n="10">10 The worst is, that by scattering the body of our Lord in many places at once, the Church of Rome maketh the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of the Gospell not onely doubtfull but also ridiculous. For if the body of Iesus Christ can be in diuerse places at once, and distant one farre from another, and neuerthelesse still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine an humane body, who can assure me that then when Iesus Christ was vpon the crosse, he was not walking in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place? and that when he was before <hi>Pilate</hi> in Ierusalem, he was not asleepe in Alexandria? and that when he was in the blessed virgine <hi>Maries</hi> wombe, he was not in other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens wombes? And why Iesus Christ went so often from Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee to Ierusalem, seeing that without stirring from Galilee he might be in Ierusalem? Why <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Marie</hi> hauing left him in Ierusalem against their wils, turned backe againe to fetch him, seeing that he might haue stayed in Ierusalem, and yet by their doctrine he might haue followed them all at
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:11462:272"/> one time?</p>
                  <p n="11">11. For it is to little purpose to say, that as then the body of Christ was not yet glorified: seeing that in the institution of this Sacrament he was yet weake and not glorified, and yet they say, that then his body was whole vnder euery part of the hoast, and in euery one of his disciples mouthes.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. If for an answer thereunto they aske vs, and say, Is not God powerfull enough to do it? I will likewise answer them, and say, That God is no lesse powerfull to do otherwise, and that he is wise to do no such thing. All that which is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Alcoran may be proued in the same manner, by say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God is able to do so. The will, and not the power of God is the rule of our beleefe. It is a great wrong to binde the omnipotent power of God to do all that which we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine or conceiue, and to bind it with ridiculous bands, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of exalting him, to make him captiue to vs. God is omnipotent because he doth all whatsoeuer he will, and not all that we will prescribe vnto him. But we haue seene before that the will of God is cleane contrary vnto that which our aduersaries will haue him to will.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. And though we ought onely to endeuour to exalt the omnipotencie of God without making inquirie of his will, yet it shall appeare that we exalt the power of God and of our Lord Iesus Christ, and that our aduersaries diminish and derogate from it.</p>
                  <p>For, it is much more agreeable to the power of Iesus Christ to communicate himselfe vnto vs without comming downe here vpon earth: as the Sunne is much more admirable by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it selfe present with vs so farre off, and making vs feele his vertue, then if he should come downe nearer the earth.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Adde hereunto, that vnder the hoast, Iesus Christ is not onely put into the power of a man, but also made so vnable, that our aduersaries acknowledge, that vnder the <hi>species</hi> he can neither breathe, moue, nor open his eyes: for how should he there change place seeing he hath no place?

<pb n="501" facs="tcp:11462:272"/> all mouing requires some extention.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Is it an exalting of the Maiestie and greatnesse of the eternall Sonne of God, to make him subiect to the will of a Priest, which many times is not an honest man; who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth Iesus Christ when he will, carrieth him whither he will, and keepes him vnder locke and key? and to make cautions, and prouisions against all inconueniences that may happen, if the bloud shal chance to be spilt, or to freese, or if rats gnaw or eate the body of Iesus Christ, or if the Priest by weakenesse or drunkennesse, casteth vp the hoast out of his stomacke? Is it an honoring of God, and of his eternall Sonne, to call God an hoast, that may be stolen away? that may receiue cuts with a knife, like the Iesus Christ of Billetes in Paris? that may be carried away by beasts? that may fall into the dirt, and being fallen cannot rise againe? For although they say that Iesus Christ suffereth nothing by all that, because he is impassible, yet thereby he is greatly dishonored, and the Sonne of God is openly derided, and exposed to the laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the enemies of the Gospell.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. It is also a dishonour to Iesus Christ to make men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that the bones and relikes of Saints, dead at the least 12. or 15. hundred yeares before, can remaine without rotting: and yet by experience to acknowledge, that the hoast be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh mouldy in a few dayes, and that the presence of Iesus Christ, which is in it (as they say) doth not preserue it from ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and the teeth of beasts.</p>
                  <p n="17">17.

And it is to be noted, that then the holy Supper was not instituted, nor in two yeares after.</p>
                  <p>The difference betweene vs &amp; our aduersaries consisteth in this eating. We say, that in this Chapter he speaketh onely of a spirituall eating which is done by faith in the same manner, as in the fourth Chapter Iesus Christ speaketh to the Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritane woman, of a water, whereof whosoeuer shall drinke, shall neuer thirst: where he speaketh not of a materiall water but of a spirituall grace. But our aduersaries say, that in this Chapter he speaketh of two sorts of eating, the one spirituall by faith, which is continued from the 32. to the 50. verse: the other corporall, which is done by the mouth of the body, by the which Iesus Christ is really eaten with the mouth in the
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:11462:273"/> Eucharist: whereof they say Iesus Christ speaketh in the rest of the Chapter.</p>
                  <p>But if we examine the whole tenour of Christs speech, we shall not finde any one clause therein, which is not contrary to this kind of eating of Iesus Christ with the mouth.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the 32. and 50. verses he saith, that he is the bread that came downe from heauen, shewing, that that bread is not onely the flesh of Iesus Christ, (for that descended not from heauen) but also his Diuinitie. Then if that bread which descended from heauen should be eaten with the mouth, we must also eate the Diuinitie.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In the 35 verse he saith, <hi>I am the bread of life:</hi> words which serue for the vnderstanding of these words, <hi>This is my bodie.</hi> For if by these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> we must vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, <hi>This is transsubstantiated into my body;</hi> we must also by these words, <hi>I am the bread,</hi> vnderstand that Iesus Christ is transsubstantiated into bread.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Iesus Christ addeth, <hi>He that beleeueth in me, shall neuer thirst.</hi> Where plainly he putteth, <hi>to beleeue,</hi> in stead of, <hi>to drinke;</hi> seeing he saith, that by beleeuing our thirst shall be quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched. The coherence of his discourse,<note place="margin">Bellar. lib. <hi>1.</hi> de Euchar. c. <hi>7.</hi> Verba quae ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantur non pertinent ad Sacramentum propriè, sed ad fidem incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationis.</note> and the naturall conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, requireth that he should haue said, <hi>He that drinketh shall neuer thirst:</hi> but he said, <hi>He that beleeueth,</hi> in stead of, <hi>He that drinketh;</hi> to teach vs, that he speaketh of a drinke which is taken by faith. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> acknowledgeth the same, and confesseth that in that place there is nothing spoken of the Sacrament, but of faith in the incarnation.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The 47 verse is likewise plaine, where the Lord saith, <hi>He that beleeueth in me hath life eternall: I am that bread of life.</hi> There he sheweth, that this bread is taken by faith. For, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he which beleeueth in him hath life euerlasting, from thence he inferreth, that he is the bread of life.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In the 50 verse he addeth, <hi>If any man eateth of this bread he shall not die:</hi> and in the 54 verse, <hi>He that eateth my flesh, hath life euerlasting.</hi> Then wicked persons eate not the flesh of our Lord, because they haue not life eternall. For it is certaine that Iesus Christ speaketh not of eating with the mouth, nor
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:11462:274"/> of the Eucharist: for many eate thereof, which haue not life eternall; as <hi>Iudas,</hi> and an infinite number of hypocrites. Our aduersaries to excuse themselues, adde somewhat hereunto, which is fetcht out of their own braines, and not to be found in the word of God: for they say, that Iesus Christ vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, that he that eateth his flesh worthily, hath life eternall. But this word <hi>worthily,</hi> is vnworthily added by them, and cleane contrary to the truth, seeing that thereby they suppose that a man may eate the flesh of our Lord vnworthily. For seeing that to eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, is to trust in his death, as we haue proued (and our aduersaries confesse it,) it is manifest, that no man can vnworthily beleeue in Iesus Christ, seeing that all our worthinesse consisteth in beleeuing in Iesus Christ. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1. Cor. 11. speaketh of eating the bread vnworthily, but not of eating the Lords body vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily. A man may take the signe, but not the truth vnworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Therefore, as to excuse themselues touching the place in Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> they adde their owne imagination to the word of God; so to defend themselues against this place of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> they make a figure thereof. And this word <hi>worthily</hi> being by them added, yet that place is still contrary to the Church of Rome, which beleeueth, that many which haue taken the host worthily, are damned.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The 53. verse is of no lesse force, where Iesus Christ saith, <hi>Except ye eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, ye haue no life in you.</hi> There it is plaine, that he speaketh not of eating the Sacrament with the mouth: for he speaketh of an eating necessary to saluation, without the which man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue eternall life. Now many attaine to eternall life, which neuer participated in that Sacrament, as Saint <hi>Iohn Baptist,</hi> the theefe crucified with Iesus Christ, and many faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full persons that died before they were partakers of the same. If we do not eate the flesh of the Lord but in the Sacrament, what shall become of so many faithfull persons which did not participate in the same? Then here againe they adde ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther peece vnto the word of God: for they say, that Iesus Christ would haue said, If you eate not the flesh of the Sonne
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:11462:274"/> of man while you haue meanes to do it, you shall not haue life eternall. There is no expresse sentence in the Scripture, which may not be peruerted, by thrusting in of words, and adding somewhat of our owne imaginations. And yet this being added, this place condemneth the Church of Rome, which beleeueth not, that all those that receiue not the hoast at Easter, when they haue meanes to do it, are therefore dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. The Church of Rome neuer giueth the consecrated host to men that are condemned to die, yet our aduersaries do not beleeue that they are damned.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. In the 56 verse the Lord addeth, <hi>He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> This concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not eating with the mouth, either in regard of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, or in regard of the faithfull. For if an hypocrite hath receiued the Sacrament, that makes him not to dwell in Iesus Christ: and if a faithfull person hath receiued it, the Church of Rome doth not beleeue that Iesus Christ dwelleth in him: for she saith, that as soone as the <hi>species</hi> are digested in the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macke, the body of Iesus Christ is no more there.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Lastly, Iesus Christ, to aduertise his disciples that his words ought not to be taken in a carnall and grosse sence, but to shew them that they are quickning and spirituall, saith vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>These words are spirit and life.</hi> But they giue not life, if they be not taken spiritually.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. You must also note, that in all this discourse, wherein he promiseth to giue his flesh to be eaten, he spake to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaitan Iewes, to whom he neuer administred the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, and which continued obstinately in their Iewish opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. It is certaine that Iesus Christ is no lyer. If he had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to administer the Sacrament to the Capernaitans, he wold haue kept his promise. And the vnworthinesse of the Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naitans could not haue kept the Lord from offering the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament vnto them according to his promise, which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse he did not. By this meanes our aduersaries, as much as in them lyeth, make Iesus Christ a lyer.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. We must likewise remember, that the Eucharist was not as then instituted, till two yeares after; and yet at that
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:11462:275"/> time Iesus Christ was the true bread of life. For in the 35 verse he saith, <hi>I am the bread of life:</hi> and in the 50 verse, <hi>This is the bread, &amp;c.</hi> and in the 54 verse, <hi>He that eateth my flesh, &amp;c.</hi> From that time therefore this bread was eaten by the faithfull, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Eucharist was not then instituted.</p>
                  <p>We must not thinke it strange, if sometimes he speaketh in the future tense, saying, <hi>This bread which I will giue you, &amp;c.</hi> for he had a respect to his death, wherein he was to giue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe for the life of the world.</p>
                  <p>We must not likewise wonder when the Lord saith, <hi>that his flesh is meate indeed:</hi> for this word <hi>indeed,</hi> doth not hinder but that the word flesh may be taken figuratiuely, no more then when Iesus Christ in the 15.1. of S. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>I am the true vine;</hi> where the word <hi>true</hi> excludeth not the figure. Figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue words ceasse not to be true: seeing that the flesh of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ crucified is the true food of our soules. The soule hath two principall faculties, the vnderstanding and the will: the vnderstanding is nourished by instruction, the wil by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation. The flesh of Iesus Christ crucified furnisheth these two nourishments. For by the death of Iesus Christ we are certified and instructed of and in the meanes that God hath ordained to reconcile himselfe vnto vs; and that onely is our soueraigne consolation, for without it our soules languish and wither in despaire, like a member fallen into a consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or like a body destitute of nourishment.</p>
                  <p>We must not thinke it strange, that our Sauiour Iesus Christ vsed this allegory, seeing that not long before he vsed the like allegory, speakng to the Samaritan woman, of a water whereof whosoeuer shall drinke,<note place="margin">Ioh. 4.</note> shall neuer thirst. And that it is an ordinary thing in the Scripture, to call the word of God and his graces, sometimes bread, sometimes milke, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times strong meate. Besides that, Iesus Christ had particular reasons to moue him to speake in that manner to the Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naitans, that had as it were forcibly constrained him to vse that allegory, importunately asking him, if he could do as <hi>Moses</hi> did, that gaue them bread from heauen. As also that they were incredulous, to whom he vsed to speake by figures
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:11462:275"/> and parables, as Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> 13.34. saith, <hi>And without a parable spake he not vnto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our aduersaries themselues acknowledge, that to the 50. verse, Iesus Christ did not speake of eating of the Sacrament with the mouth, but by faith: but in the verses following they say, that he speaketh of eating with the mouth. And yet in all that chapter there is nothing said of two kinds of eatings, nor any thing that should moue vs to vnderstand that speech of Iesus Christ otherwise.</p>
                  <p>And I wonder how they dare in such manner contradict<note n="*" place="margin">De spiritua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li comestione Dominus ait: Nisi mandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caueritis car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem filij ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis &amp; bibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis eius san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem, non habebitis vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tam in vobis.

In this manner those onely that are good eate the body of our Lord. And therefore he saith, He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me, and I in him. For he that dwelleth in charitie dwelleth in God, and God in him. Why dost thou prepare thy teeth and thy belly? Beleeue, and thou hast eaten.</p>
                  <p>With the like obstinacie they oppose themselues against Pope <hi>Gelasius,</hi> who in his booke against <hi>Eutyches,</hi> and against <hi>Nestorius,</hi> speaketh thus of the holy Sacrament.<note n="*" place="margin">Certè sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta quae su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mimus corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris &amp; sangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Christi, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uina res est, propter quod &amp; per eadem diuinae effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur consortes naturae, &amp; ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men esse non definit sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantia vel natura panis &amp; vini.

And certainly the image and resemblance of the body and of the bloud of Christ is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated in this mysterie.

                  <p>The Decretall of the Romish Church, in the second Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Consecration, is full of expresse sentences to that purpose.

                  <p>We conclude therefore, that in this chapter Iesus Christ speaketh not of eating his body with the mouth, neither vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth that he must go downe into our stomackes. For the nourishment of the soule is not receiued by the mouth of the body. To feede the body by hearing, and to feed the soule by the mouth, are two like absurdities. It is not more absurd to feede the stomacke with songs, then to cause the nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the soule to passe through our teeth and our throats. Iesus Christ cannot be eaten by his enemies, much lesse by beasts. He is the bread of children, and not of strangers. This bread is giuen to the liuing, and not to the dead: to dwell in vs, and not to passe through vs. It is a meate necessary for sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and not as the Sacrament of his body, without the which many are saued, and which turnes to many mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.

For as in stead of a quantitie of bread to communicate to all the assembly, at this day they haue but a litle round wafer, which they call god: so whereas those prayers were said ouer the bread and the wine, now the
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:11462:277"/> same prayers are said ouer the consecrated host, which they say is Iesus Christ. Whereby it happeneth, that in those prayers the Priest speaketh against his owne intent, and plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicteth his Churches beleefe, and pronounceth words that are iniurious to Iesus Christ.</p>
                  <p>For after the words of<note n="*" place="margin">Panem san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum vitae ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternae, &amp; cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem salutis perpetuae.

This prayer might be said vpon the offerings and almes of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but in no sort can be vpon Iesus Christ. For is there any likelihood that Iesus Christ should be called These things, as if they spake of diuerse Iesus Christs, and of things without life? Againe, can he without impiety desire God to accept as well of Iesus Christ, as he accepted the beasts sacrificed by <hi>Abel?</hi> Their ordinary excuse in this is, that the Priest doth not desire God to accept as well of Iesus Christ, as he did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the lambe offered by <hi>Abel,</hi> but that God would be pleased to accept as well of our deuotion as of that of <hi>Abels:</hi> But the words of the Masse will not beare this exposition, which compare not <hi>Abels</hi> deuotion with ours, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents which the Priest offereth to God, with those that <hi>Abel</hi> offered, saying, Accept as well of these sacrifices and of these presents, as thou diddest accept of <hi>Abels</hi> presents. The hoast and the present is not the deuotion. There is great difference betweene a present and the will, which oftentimes is accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without a present.</p>
                  <p>The Priest addeth,<note n="*" place="margin">Supplices te rogamus om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotens Deus, iube haec per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferri per ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus sancti An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geli tui in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime altare tuum.</note> We beseech thee most puissant God, to command that these things may be borne by the hands of thy holy Angell into thy heauenly Pallace, into the presence of thy diuine Maiestie. Is there any thing in all this that can be applied to Iesus Christ? Is Iesus Christ presented by the Angels to his Father? Hath he any need of the helpe of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to be presented to God?</p>
                  <p>There followeth a prayer for the dead,<note n="**" place="margin">Memento etiam Domine famulorum fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mularumque tuarum qui nos praecesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt cum sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no fidei &amp; dormiunt in somno pacis.</note> saying, Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thy seruants which haue gone before vs with the
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:11462:277"/> signe of faith, and that sleepe in peace. For then they beleeued not that mens soules were burnt in a fire.</p>
                  <p>After this there followeth a long catalogue of the names of many Saints; which rehearsed,<note place="margin">Intra quorum nos consortium non aestimator meriti sed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae largitor admittas, per Christum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum nostrū, per quem Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine haec om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia semper bona creas, sanctificas, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uificas, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis.</note> they make this prayer to God, saying, In whose company we beseech thee to receiue vs, not regarding our merits, but pardoning our offences. This is contrarie to merits.</p>
                  <p>But the words that immediatly follow, are specially to be considered, where it is said, By Christ our Lord, by whom, oh Lord, thou alwaies createst for vs all these good things, thou sanctifiest, quickenest, and blessest them. Is there any thing in all this that agreeth to Iesus Christ? For can they call the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrated bread (which they call the host) all these good things, if that hoast be Iesus Christ? Doth God alwayes quicken Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ? Doth God create &amp; quicken Iesus Christ, by Iesus Christ? These speeches are fit being applied to the bread and wine, but not vnto Iesus Christ. If by these words they vnderstand that he speaketh of the bread and wine, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them as they were before consecration, thereby they fall into three ineuitable absurdities. The one is, that they giue thankes vnto God, because he created the bread and the wine in the Eucharist, when that bread and wine is no more bread and wine; The second is, he sheweth the bread and the wine, as being present, saying, <hi>Haec omnia bona,</hi> All these good things, when those things are no more those good things; vsing a demonstratiue pronowne of a thing present, to shew nothing. The third absurditie is, that those words are spoken then when the Priest is about to lift vp the hoast to cause it to be adored. Is not this a thing against all reason and apparence, that then when men adore the hoast, and pretend to sacrifice the eternall Sonne of God to God, the Priest gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth thankes to God because he causeth the bread and wine to grow? and remembreth not to giue him thankes, because he hath put Iesus Christ into his hands to sacrifice and to eate him? As if then when they are to render vp their soules vnto God, they should giue thankes vnto God, because he maketh it raine vpon the vines, without giuing him thankes for redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:11462:278"/> our soules from hell, by the death of Iesus Christ.</p>

For Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent</hi> the third, in the second booke of the Mysteries of the Masse 58. chap. saith, that the Priest makes signes of the Crosse vpon these things to driue away the diuell, lest he should pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile against the Priest, or against the sacrifice, that is, against Iesus Christ. But it is not credible that those who brought in that custome, would be so ridiculously officious, as to take on them by signes of the Crosse made in the aire, to defend Iesus Christ against the diuell.</p>

                  <p>The Masse (as we haue seene) hath diuers formall prayers against Transsubstantiation: yet there is a manifest fraud vsed, and a changing of the ancient Liturgie.

Much lesse is it to be beleeued, that if the consecrated hoast be Iesus Christ himselfe, that the Pastors of the Church would haue perswaded the Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meni that it is not so; seeing that at this day they make little children beleeue it. I know that the Fathers spake of the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of faith with more sobriety before the Catechumeni, but it is one thing to speake to the Catechumeni, and another thing to write and preach to the faithfull, as the Fathers in these places do. Let vs hereunto adde ancient customes. The Christians in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time made a banket in the Church, wherein they did eate the remainder of the Sacrament. In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places they gaue that which was left to little children. And in other places they burnt the rest of the sacred bread which was left.

And he speakes of widowes; a thing which at this day would be held to be prophane; &amp; which in truth would be very inconuenient, if that which were giuen them to beare and administer were the true and naturall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the Sonne of God. Then also they gaue the Sacrament into the hands of the people, and sometimes they suffered them to carrie it home to their houses.<note n="*" place="margin">Ambrosius oratione de obitu fratris Satyri.</note>

                  <p>Things which would neuer haue bene suffered if they had beleeued that the bread had bene the true body of Christ. Then they spake not of concomitance, nor of putting the whole body into euery drop of wine in the cup: nor of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents without substance, nor of a body without a place. They vsed no lifting vp of the host, and the people reuerenced the
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:11462:282"/> symbols and signes, but adored not the Sacrament as God. They adored Iesus Christ in the action of the Eucharist, not as being inclosed in the bread, but as being in heauen on the right hand of God. And the consecration of the bread was not made by these words <hi>This is my body,</hi> but by prayer. <hi>Iustin Martyr</hi> at the end of his second Apologie,<note n="*" place="margin">

S. <hi>Augustine</hi> in his 4 chap. and third booke of the Trinitie, saith, That which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the fruits of the earth and consecrated by mysticall prayer. <hi>Theodoretus</hi> alledged before, bringeth in the Heretick speaking in this manner, saying,<note n="*" place="margin">

Then consecration was done before they said these words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> which Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the 3. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth, as we haue already shewed.</p>
                  <p>That which deceiueth many men, is diuerse bookes falsly attributed to the ancient Fathers, as the booke of the Supper of our Lord attributed to Saint <hi>Cyprian:</hi> the Catecheticall Orations of <hi>Gregorie Nissen:</hi> the Catechesis Mystagogicke placed at the end of <hi>Cyrils</hi> Catechisme: and diuerse the like false bookes, which were not brought forth till many yeares after the death of the authors of whom they beare the name, the style and doctrine thereof wholly repugning the authors to whom they are attributed.</p>
                  <p>To no better purpose they produce the rhetoricall am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifications of certaine Fathers in their Homilies, where
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:11462:282"/> they speake of chewing and grinding the flesh of the Lord between their teeth, of thrusting their fingers into his wounds, of embracing his crosse, of making the altar red with the bloud of the Lord: of hote coales brought with tongues by Seraphins, &amp;c. Excessiue speeches vsed to rauish the spirits of the auditors, and such as if a man presse accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the letter, would bring in a thousand absurdities.</p>
                  <p>But the greatest matter which they alledge, and whereat they stumble, is, that oftentimes among the ancient Fathers that which is receiued in the Eucharist, is called the body of Christ, and that they say that the Priest with his sacred mouth, maketh the body of Christ. But he that hath read the ancient Fathers, knoweth that they make two sorts of the body of Christ, one that was crucified for vs, the other which is receiued in the Eucharist, whereof the last is eaten by the faithfull, but the other can not be eaten with the mouth. Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> vpon the Epistle to the Ephesians saith:<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> De Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secr. Can. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur caro Christi, vel spiritualis illa atque diuina de qua ipse ait, caro mea est verè cibus, vel Caro ea quae crucifixa est, &amp; sanguis qui militis effusus est lancea.</note> The flesh and the bloud of Christ is vnderstood two wayes, either that spirituall and diuine flesh, whereof he himselfe saith, My flesh is meate indeed; or that flesh which was crucified, &amp; that bloud which was shed by the souldiers speare. And the same Father in 2. Distinction of Consecration saith:<note n="**" place="margin">Can. De hac quidem hostia quae in Christi com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoratione mirabiliter fit, edere licet. De illa verò quam Christus in ara crucis obtulit, secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dùm se nulli edere licet.</note> We are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to eate of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> hoast which is wonderfully made in remē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of Christ. But it is not lawfull for any man to eate of y<seg rend="sup">t</seg> same hoast which Christ offered vpon the tree of the crosse.</p>
                  <p>Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> oftentimes speaketh of eating the body of Christ: but to the end that men should know that it is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body then that which was crucified, writing vpon the 98. Psalme, he produceth Iesus Christ speaking in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: You shall not eate this body which you see, neither shall you drinke the bloud which those that shall crucifie me shall shed. What body then do they eate? He expoundeth it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe and saith: I haue recommended a Sacrament vnto you, which being taken spiritually will giue you life.</p>
                  <p>So before we heard <hi>Origen</hi> call the bread of the Eucharist, <hi>the body of Christ symbolically;</hi> and a body which in some sort is an holy thing, to discerne it from the naturall body. And S.
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:11462:283"/>
                     <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his third Epistle of his second booke saith,<note n="*" place="margin">Si vinum tantùm quis offerat, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guis Christi incipit esse si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne nobis, si ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rò aqua sola sit, plebs inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit esse sine Christo.</note>
                     <hi>Corpus Domini non potest esse farina sola, nec aqua sola:</hi> The body of our Lord cannot be meale alone, nor water alone; because meale must be kneaded with water. There also he will haue water to be mixed with wine, because wine is the bloud of Christ, and water the people, for that the bloud of Christ must not be without the people.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ephraem</hi> before alledged by vs, saith, that the body of Christ which the faithfull receiue, loseth not his sensible sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, euen as water in baptisme is still water. It is clearer then the day light, that by the body of Christ, he vnderstandeth not the naturall body of our Lord, seeing he maketh that body in the Eucharist to be the same that water is in baptisme, that is, an externall signe. And <hi>Ephraem</hi> should in vaine say, that the naturall body of Iesus Christ doth not lose his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in the Eucharist; for who euer imagined that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body of our Lord loseth his substance in the holy Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or is no more a man?</p>
                  <p>The same also appeareth by this, that the Fathers oftentimes speake of peeces or parts of the body of Christ which are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the people in the Eucharist, which can not be said of the crucified body.</p>
                  <p>So in the Canon,<note n="*" place="margin">Comperimus quòd quidam sumpta tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tummodo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris sacri portione à ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice sacrati cruoris absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neant.</note>
                     <hi>Comperimus,</hi> in the second Distinction of Consecration, Pope <hi>Gelasius</hi> complaineth of some that hauing taken a part of the body of Christ, abstained from the cup.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregorie Nissen,</hi> in his booke of Baptisme, saith that the consecrated bread is no more common bread, but is called, &amp; is, the body of Christ. But he declareth how it is bread, and yet it is the body of Christ, by the similitude of the water in baptisme, and of stones of an altar, which are of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that others are, but become holy by blessing. By these examples he manifestly excludeth transsubstantiation. The place is long and worthy to be read.</p>
                  <p>This being so, it shall not be amisse to know how Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> will haue the bread still continuing bread, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to become the body of Christ by diuine vertue. Which he declareth in the fourth chap. of the fourth booke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:11462:283"/> where he propoundeth this question, <hi>Hoc igitur astruamus, quomodo potest qui panis est, esse corpus Christi:</hi> Let vs shew how that which is bread, may be the body of Christ. By which question it appeares that he will haue bread &amp; Christs body at the same time. And thereupon he produceth diuerse workes of God, whereby he hath made things to be that which they were not. And so inferreth, that by greater reason God can make things that were, to be the same still, and yet to be changed into other things. His words are these. <hi>Si ergo tanta vis est in sermone Domini Iesu, vt inciperent esse quae non e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, quanto magis operatorius est vt sint quae erant, &amp; in aliud commutentur?</hi> Then if there be such vertue in the words of our Lord, to make those things that were not to begin to be, how much more can he make those things that were before, to be the same that they were, and yet be changed into another thing? He will haue the bread to remaine bread, and neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse to be the body of Christ.</p>
                  <p>Howbeit, such kindes of speaking haue bene stumbling blocks at which the ages ensueing haue stumbled, specially since the holy Scriptures haue bene hidden from the people: and that men to aduance themselues aboue Angels, haue boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted that they make God with words, &amp; create their creator.</p>

Why Iesus Christ hauing said of that bread which he gaue, that it was his body, he hath taught that that bread is no more bread, but becometh the body of Christ? Why he durst belie the Apostle Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who foure times saith, that we breake and eate bread? Why, seeing that the holy Sacrament is instituted for the remission of sinnes, he hath wincked at the prophanation thereof vsed in the Church of Rome, to say Masse for horses, &amp; sicke hogs, and to sing particular Masses to draw soules out of Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie, if they be rich mens soules that haue giuen some thing to the Church? What can these venerable Doctors answer hereunto? Will they say, Lord, the Church hath iudged otherwise, and hath found it conuenient to change the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this Sacrament, and that his Vicar the Pope may dispence against the Apostles, and against the Gospell in giuing it interpretations. Do they thinke that such excuses
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:11462:284"/> will be admitted in that fearfull iudgement, or that thereby they can defend themselues from that heate of the fire that shall consume the aduersaries?</p>

Our Lord giuing the Cup to his disciples, said vnto them, <hi>Drinke ye all of this:</hi> the Church of Rome correcteth that, and saith, <hi>You shall not all drinke thereof,</hi> for to drinke at the Masse is the priuiledge of Priests, and of Kings and Princes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They make answer and say, that Iesus Christ spake one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Pastors, for all those that then were present were Pastors of the Church. But the Church of Rome giuing the Cup to Kings and Princes, sheweth that she doth not beleeue that that commandement was made onely to Pastors of the Church.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Moreouer, Iesus Christs disciples being with him, were not as Pastors, but as sheepe and disciples, and in that action are also called disciples.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It is manifest, that in the institution of the Supper, the
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:11462:285"/> commandement to eate and to drinke was indifferently made to those persons that were present. And if the people are not bound to communicate the cup, because those to whom Iesus gaue it were Pastors; by the same reason the people may dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spense with themselues touching the participation of the bread, vnder pretence that those were Pastors to whom Iesus Christ said, <hi>Eate.</hi> And so there is nothing in the whole institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament which bindeth the people to receiue any of the two kinds, nor yet at all to participate this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. What is he that can iudge or discerne, that these words of our Lord, <hi>Take, eate,</hi> are directed to the Pastors and to the people, but that these words <hi>Drinke ye all of this,</hi> are onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to Pastors? There is nothing then in the institution of the Supper which directeth the faithfull, and yet the institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament is the rule it selfe. And though we looke elsewhere for the commandement to eate made to the people, we shall alwayes finde that there also is mention made of drinking.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Our aduersaries themselues confesse, that Iesus Christ by these words, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi> commanded his disciples to do the same to the faithfull that he did to them: He commanded therefore to giue the cup to the faithfull.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Besides, our Lord administring the cup, said, <hi>That it is the new Testament in his bloud, which is shed for the remission of sinnes.</hi> Then it appeareth, that to depriue the people of the cup, is as much as to depriue them of the shedding of his bloud for the remission of sinnes. For our aduersaries say that there is no effusion of bloud in the hoast.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And when Iesus said, <hi>This is my body which is giuen, and broken for you,</hi> did he vnderstand that it should onely be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for Pastors, or broken for their saluation, and not for the saluation of the people? And if it be impious to affirme that touching the body, why should it be lesse impious to be said touching the cup?</p>

He saith not (as some affirme) Examine your selues before you drink. The Greek hath <gap reason="foreign" resp="#oxf">

                     </gap>, <hi>Let him eate,</hi> which is the Imperatiue moode, and a word of commandement, and not a conditionall word, if he will eate, or when he would eate, let him examine himselfe. If the King ordaineth that a souldier should arme himselfe, and that he should fight cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiously, he commandeth him to arme himselfe &amp; to fight: so when the Apostle saith to the faithfull, that they should ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine themselues, and that they should eate and drinke that bread and that wine, he commandeth them both to examine themselues, and to eate that bread and drinke that wine. And if the Apostle had said no otherwise, but that the faithfull must examine themselues before they drinke, he would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suppose thereby that the faithfull dranke, and that in Corinth the people participated the cup.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. It is true, that it sufficeth to receiue one of the <hi>species</hi> vnworthily to make a man culpable; whereupon the Apostle saith, <hi>Whosoeuer shall eate this bread, and drinke this cup of the Lord vnworthily, shall be guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord.</hi> But that hindreth not the faithfull from participating both the one and the other kind. Yet I am not of opinion, that a man that taketh one of the <hi>species</hi> vnworthily, can take the other worthily.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But the nature of falshood specially appeareth in this, that it contradicteth it selfe. For when Iesus Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. said, <hi>Except you eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his bloud, you haue no life in you:</hi> here our aduersaries expresly affirme and maintaine, that Iesus Christ spake of the Eucharist, and of eating with the mouth: treading the authority of Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> 3. vnder their feete, that determined the conttary, as we haue shewed before. Howbeit by this they make a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse against themselues, and testifie, that as much as in them
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:11462:286"/> lieth, they depriue the people of life eternall. For it is said, <hi>If you drinke not, you haue no life in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their answer is, That the bloud is also in the hoast, and that in taking the body we take the bloud also. For to take the bloud vnder the hoast, is not to drinke; but Iesus Christ commandeth vs to drinke, saying, <hi>If you drinke not, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If to take the drie hoast, is to drinke, we must say that the Priest drinkes twise in the Masse, once when he takes the hoast, the other when he takes the cup. Which discouereth the childish subtiltie of those that say, that Iesus Christ in this place of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> doth not expresse the manner how to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, but sheweth the substance of the thing. For he speaketh of drinking, and drinking is the manner of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating. Is there any hope euer to bring these men to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that play with the word of God, and perceiuing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to be grounded, haue their recourse to such ridiculous defences, as to maintaine that to eate the hoast, is to drinke? If we take eating and drinking for beleeuing (as Iesus Christ in this chapter expoundeth it) it is certaine, that to eate and to drinke are all one thing. But betweene eating the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the mouth, and drinking, there is great difference.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Adde hereunto, that he which taketh the bloud vnder the hoast, taketh it not as being shed for vs, nor with the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the shedding of his bloud, which is the manner whereby Iesus Christ will haue euery man to participate the same. The faithfull in eating the bread may remember the shedding of his bloud, but God will haue the memory and the exterior signe to go together. And we must not content our selues with the memorie, to abolish a part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, because it is instituted to celebrate the memorie of the shedding of the bloud. For, if the memorie of the shedding of the bloud were sufficient, without participating the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the shedding of the bloud, we might also dispence with our selues for participating the Sacrament of the body, for that the preaching of the word might refresh our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries therein.</p>

A custome which hauing bene practised in the latter times by some am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Prelates, is now reserued for the Pope onely, for a marke of his greatnesse.<note n="**" place="margin">Tanta esset dignitas laico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rū circa sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem corporis Christi sicut &amp; sacerdotum.</note>
                     <hi>Gerson</hi> in the second Treatise of the Communion vnder both kinds, puts this among the causes why the people should be depriued of the Cup, to wit, that thereby the dignitie of lay men would be equall with the Priests. Their onely intent therefore herein is, the honour and exaltation of the Clergie.</p>
                  <p>The Councell of Constance holden <hi>anno</hi> 1416. which is the first Councel that forbad the Cup to be administred to the people, vpon paine of heresie, and punishment to be imposed by the secular powers, confesseth that Iesus Christ did insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the holy Supper vnder both kinds, and that the primitiue Church did so practise it. Notwithstanding it saith, that the contrary custome ought to be holden for a law; and declareth all those to be heretickes and punishable which contradict it. You shall see the whole Canon, which (as error loueth dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) those Fathers haue purposely obscured, promiscuously handling it with the question touching the receiuing of the Eucharist after supper. The words of the Canon are these:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seeing that in some parts of the world, some men dare rashly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that Christian people ought to receiue the Sacrament of the Eucharist vnder both kinds, and ordinarily giue the Communion to the laitie, not onely vnder the forme of bread, but also vnder the forme of wine, and that after supper, or otherwise not fasting; and obstinately affirme that it must be so communicated, contrary to the laudable custome of the Church, reasonably brought in, which they damnably seeke to reproue as sacrilegious. For this cause this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent sacred generall Councell of Constance, lawfully assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by the holy Ghost, against this error, seeking to prouide for the
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:11462:287"/> saluation of the faithfull, after ripe deliberation had by diuerse Doctors as well spirituall as temporal, declareth, decreeth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fineth, that although Iesus Christ after supper did institute and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister to his disciples, this venerable Sacrament vnder the formes of bread and wine; notwithstanding, the authoritie of the sacred Canons, and the commendable and approued customes of the Church haue declared, and do declare, that this Sacrament ought not to be celebrated after supper, nor by the faithful to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued but fasting, vnlesse it be in case of weaknesse, or other necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties permitted by law or by the Church. And likewise, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the primitiue Church this Sacrament was receiued by the faithful vnder both kinds, neuerthelesse, this custome hath with reason bene induced, that it should be taken, by those that consecrate, vnder both kinds, and by the laitie vnder the forme of bread onely. For that we must constantly, and without any doubt beleeue, that the whole bodie and bloud of Iesus Christ is truly contained as well vnder the forme of bread, as vnder the forme of wine. Therefore, seeing that this custome hath bin reasonably induced, and long time practised by the Church and by the holy Fathers, it must be holden for a law, which it is not lawfull to reproue, or to change at our fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies, without the authoritie of the Church. Therefore to affirme, that to obserue this custome or law, it is sacriledge or an vnlawfull thing, that opinion ought to be held to be erroneous; and those that obstinately affirme the contrary of that which is said before, ought to be banished as hereticks, and grieuously punished by the Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans of the places where they reside, or by their Officials, or by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitors of hereticall peruersities, &amp;c.</hi> To speake in this maner, what is it else but to spit in the face of the Sonne of God, and to tread the Gospell vnder their feete?</p>

<pb n="531" facs="tcp:11462:287"/> were sharper sighted then Iesus Christ, or as if they could propound some inconuenience which Christ did not foresee. <hi>Gerson</hi> that was at the Councell of Constance, propoundeth the reasons that moued the Councell to prohibite the Cup vnto the people.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He saith, that it would be dangerous lest any drop of the wine should fall downe vpon the ground. But he should rather beware lest he fall into disobedience, or to suffer the authoritie of the word of God to fall downe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. He saith, that it is done lest the common people should wet their beards in the cup. But it were better that men were without beards, then without the Sacrament of the bloud of Iesus Christ: and yet women and yong men without beards might communicate without that danger.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As also lest the Chalice being kept, should take wind, or waxe sowre. But that is to take great care for Iesus Christ. For if he be present and whole in euery drop of wine within the Cup, his presence would be sufficient to keepe the wine from sowring: seeing that (if you beleeue our aduersaries) the milke of the virgin <hi>Marie</hi> waxeth not sowre, nor the bones of Saints putrifie in so many hundred yeares. To speake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this new Philosophie, which giueth vs sharpe lines, puffed vp in length and breadth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They also alledge, that thereby the Church of Rome sought to stop another heresie. But we must not remedie one euill by another, nor an error by an abuse: neither shal it euer be found that the prohibiting of the chalice did remedie any error, but onely that it serueth to strengthen the error of Transsubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They likewise say, that some countries haue no wine. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer also, that there are countries that haue no bread; and that if men can carry the one thither, they may carry the other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so: or if that be impossible, it is better in such a country to vse that which serueth there in stead of bread and wine, rather then to be wholly or in part depriued of the Sacrament. And that if there be such a countrey, whereunto men cannot carry wine, the same discommoditie happeneth as wel to the Priests
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:11462:288"/> as to the people. Adde hereunto, that if some countries can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not haue wine for the Sacrament, it followeth not but that they may be furnished from an infinite number of other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces where they may haue wine. This consideration is as badly grounded, as if I should say, that we must not heare the word of God, because those that are deafe cannot heare it: that so in matter of instruction to saluation, there may be no difference among men.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Lastly, our aduersaries (as they suppose) find examples in the new Testament of celebrating the Eucharist without the Cup. Put case that such examples were to be found, what would that make for them? For the question betweene vs, is not, whether the holy Supper may be administred without the Cup; but, whether the Cup being there, the Priest alone, and not the people, ought to drinke? Therefore they vainly alledge the 2. of Acts, 42. verse where it is said, that <hi>they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued stedfastly in the Apostles doctrine, and fellowship, and in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread, and in prayer.</hi> And Acts 20.7. where it is said, that <hi>the disciples came together to breake bread.</hi> In these places it is not said, that there was a cup, whereof the Pastor dranke and the people dranke not. And if vnder pretence, that in these places there is nothing spoken of drinking, it followeth that the people should not drinke; it will follow thereby, that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stors also ought not to drinke; for there is nothing spoken in those places of them touching that.</p>
                  <p>It should be a ridiculous consequence, if I should say, that in the 31. of Genesis it is said, that <hi>Iacob</hi> inuited his brethren to eate bread with him; and therefore that they dranke not. It is the ordinary maner of the Scripture, by bread to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all that is set vpon the table at meale times, Gen. 37.25. Luk. 7.36. and often in other places. And there is no reason why this manner of speaking should not be allowed in a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Supper, as well as in a common repast. So there was no beast sacrificed vnder the Law without some aspersion of wine, and yet in all the sacred historie, where it is said that such a King or Priest did offer sacrifice, there is nothing spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of sprinkling of wine. For, as to know how men ought
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:11462:288"/> to celebrate sacrifices, we need not seeke in Histories or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, but must go to the rules thereof contained in the bookes of <hi>Moses:</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Dist. <hi>2.</hi> De Consecr. Can. Comperimus quòd quidam sumpta tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tummodo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poris sacri por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione à calice sacrati cruoris abstineant.

                  <p>In Pope <hi>Gelasius</hi> time, that liued in anno 495. this abuse began to spring vp, against the which the said Pope pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this sentence, saying: We haue bene aduertised that some persons hauing onely taken a peece of the sacred body, do abstaine from the Cup of the sacred bloud, who, without doubt (because it is said rhat they are led by I know not what superstition) ought, either to receiue the whole Sacrament, or to be wholly excluded from cōmunicating: because the diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a Sacrament cannot be done without great sacriledge.

               <q>We beleeue, that God will haue the world to be gouerned by lawes and policies, that there might be some restraint of the disordered desires of the world. And as he hath established kingdomes and common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths, and all other kinds of principalities, whether they be hereditary or otherwise, and all that belongeth to the state of iustice, and will be knowne to be the author thereof: so hath he put the sword into Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates hands, to represse sinnes committed not onely against the second table of the commandements of God, but also against the first. Therefore in regard thereof, we must not onely endure and suffer superiors to gouerne, but also we must honour and obey them with all reuerence: holding them for his Lieutenants and officers, whom he hath appointed to exercise a lawfull and an holy charge.</q>

Whether it be that our innocencie is knowne vnto him, and for that our Confession touching this point is so expresse, that it confuteth all sorts of slanders: or because he hath bene striken with some remorse of conscience, and is ashamed to speake any thing in this matter for the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience due to Magistrates; knowing well that the Popes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and the doctrine of the Iesuites wholly tend to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of Empires, exempteth Clergie men from the subie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of Kings, and putteth the liues and the Crownes of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Princes into the Popes power.

The Councell of Trent in the 25 Session and 20 chapter saith, that<note n="**" place="margin">Persona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticarum im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitas Dei ordinatione &amp; canonicis sanctionibus instituta est.</note> The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption of ecclesiasticall persons was instituted by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, and by canonicall constitutions. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his booke of Clerkes, 28. chapter, saith,<note n="***" place="margin">Clerici non possunt à Iudice politico puniri, vel vllo modo trahi ad secularis magistratus tribunal.</note> That Clerks may not be punished by the ciuill Iudge, nor by any meanes be brought before the iudgement seates of secular Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates.
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:11462:290"/> And in the same place he saith,<note n="*" place="margin">Summus Pontifex cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricos exemit à subiectione Principum, nō sunt amplius Reges Clerico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum superiores</note> The soueraigne Bishop hath exempted Clerks from the subiection of Princes, &amp; therefore Kings are no more Soueraignes ouer Clerks. And if our Kings and their Courts of Parlament do reserue any iurisdiction to themselues ouer the Clergie, as Appeales, their regall right vpon vacant Benefices, tythes, and the patronage of certaine Benefices, then the Clergie rage, and cry out, and say, that they violate the liberties of the Church. For the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie which Iesus Christ obtained for the Church, which consisteth in her deliuerance from the ceremonies of the Law, and in her deliuerance from the seruitude of sinne and the diuell, at this day is conuerted into an exemption from all subiection to Magistrates, and into franchises and temporall immunities. And if the Magistrate taketh any knowledge of a crime committed by any Clerke, and layeth hand on him to punish him, (as not long since it happened in Venice,) it is enough to thunder downe an Estate, and to threaten a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth to interdict it. And not to seeke for more proofes of so, manifest a thing, the Pope yearely on maundy Thursday, thundreth an excommunication against Kings &amp; Magistrates that shall take any knowledge of Ecclesiasticall causes and crimes, or that shall raise any tythes of the Clergie. This is it which it called the Bull <hi>De coena Domini;</hi> where in all cases reserued to his Holinesse are orderly set downe.</p>
                  <p>These exemptions are a great preiudice and weakening to our Kings; partly in respect of the multitude of persons that are withdrawne from the obedience of the King, which haue their Iudges and their prisons apart, and their causes are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to Rome by Appeale: and partly in regard of their goods and possessions; for the Clergie possesseth the third part of France, and the goodliest peeces of ground and houses, vpon which the King loseth his right. For a foeffe escheating to the possession of the Clergie falleth into a Mortmaine, and oweth no more personal serucie to the King, to aide him in his neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie: and in case of high treason, his goods cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscate, nor his person punished, if it pleaseth not the Bishop to degrade him, that he may become a lay man, and so punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:11462:291"/> by secular power. By this meanes the Pope hath erected an Estate temporall for himselfe in the middle of the Estates of Christian Kings. From thence it proceedeth that our Kings, in a great kingdome, raise small armies, and that the Clergie waxe fat, and the Nobilitie &amp; the third estate become poore, as the armes and the legs waxe weake, when the belly swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth with excesse. Which maketh the head (which is the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Prince) draw the lesse seruice from them. Therefore it is not without cause that many yeares since Ecclesiasticall persons haue hidden the Scripture from our Kings, because it speaketh so expresly touching this matter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the old Testament the Priests and the Leuits were subiects to Kings. It was not in the high Priests power to punish Leuites with corporall or pecuniarie punishment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. King <hi>Dauid</hi> in the first chapter of the first of Kings cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth <hi>Sadoc</hi> the high Priest and <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet, his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, saying, Take with you the seruants of your Lord, and let <hi>Sadoc</hi> the high Priest and <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet annoint him there King ouer Israel.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the second chapter, verse 26. King <hi>Salomon</hi> putteth <hi>Abiathar</hi> from the office of high Priest, and confineth him to Anathoth. And the actions done in the beginning of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> reigne are generally commended, in the third chapter, verse 3.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In the 17. of Saint Matthew Iesus Christ payed tribute, and Saint <hi>Peter</hi> with him. It cannot be said that he did it for feare, seeing he had power enough to exempt himselfe from it. It is true that being of the royall race, he had bene exempted frō paying tribute, if he had bene acknowledged in that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as he himselfe saith in that place, <hi>That the children of Kings are free.</hi> But knowing that he could not alledge his royall descent to the collectors of tribute without offending them, he subiected himselfe thereunto, in that giuing vs an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to conforme our selues to do the like.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He himselfe appeared before <hi>Pilate,</hi> as before his law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Iudge, and <hi>to whom that power was giuen from aboue,</hi> Ioh. 19.11.</p>
                  <pb n="539" facs="tcp:11462:291"/>
                  <p n="6">6. The Apostle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> appealeth to <hi>Caesar,</hi> and not to <hi>Peter.</hi> Which he did not for feare, for he would not by feare or by fraud preiudice the right of the Church: for Saint <hi>Luke</hi> Acts 23.11. witnesseth, that he did it by the motion of the Spirit of God, the Lord appearing vnto him in the night. Wherefore <hi>Bellarmine</hi> much wrongs himselfe, to say,<note place="margin">Cap. <hi>3.</hi> in Barkl.</note> that S. <hi>Pauls</hi> cause was for a point of religion, the knowledge whereof appertained not to the Magistrate. For in Acts. 24. <hi>Tertullus</hi> accused <hi>Paul</hi> to haue raised sedition, and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 25.8. defendeth himselfe by alledging, that they accused him to haue offended <hi>Caesar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. The Apostle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his first Epistle writeth to all the faithfull, and by consequence to Pastors of the Church. And therefore to them it is that in the 2.13. he saith, <hi>Submit your selues to euery ordinance of man, for the Lords sake, whether it be to the King as supreme; or vnto gouerners, as vnto them that are sent by him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="8">8. But Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> words, Romans 13.1. are most expresly set downe to that end, where he saith, <hi>Let euery soule be subiect vnto the higher powers, for there is no power but of God, the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoeuer therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God.</hi> And to the end lest some Sophister should thinke to auoide this, by saying, that Clerkes or spirituall persons are subiects to the Pope, and that he in respect of them is the superiour power; the same Apostle in the 4. and 6. verses sheweth that he speaketh of the power which beareth the sword, and whereunto tribute is payed. For then, &amp; long time after that, there was no superiour powers which bare the sword, and to whom men payed tribute, but the power of secular Princes. The interlineat Glosse confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it, where vpon these words, <hi>Potestatibus sublimioribus,</hi> the Glosse saith, <hi>Id est, saecularibus bonis &amp; malis.</hi> And it is to be noted, that then <hi>Nero</hi> reigned, a Pagan Emperour, who as he was the greatest, so he was the wickedest of all men, &amp; a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutor of the Church, to whom neuerthelesse S. <hi>Paul</hi> would haue Christians yeeld obedience. Therfore <hi>Chrysostome</hi> in his 23. Homilie vpon the Epistle to the Romans, expoundeth that

                  <p n="9">9. And to the end that men should not say, that feare of punishment, or present necessitie drew those words from the Apostle, he saith that we must be subiect to the higher po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, <hi>Not onely because of wrath,</hi> that is, not onely because we are afraid to offend the Prince, <hi>But also for conscience sake.</hi> And in the second verse he saith, <hi>Whosoeuer therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="10">10. It is either in despite or in mockerie, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in the 28. chapter of his booke of Clerkes, for the exemption of Clerkes, alledgeth an example of the Egyptian Priests that were not constrained to sell their lands through pouerty, as the other Egyptians were. For, doth it from thence follow, that their lands and possessions were exempted from tallages or tributes? And say they had bene so, may a Pagan example serue for a law in the Church of God?</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Reason also is most euident therein. For is it reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable that the King should pay souldiers that go to warre, and that he should fortifie the frontiers of his kingdome, to the end that Clerks and spirituall persons may sleepe securely, and that they should not contribute something towards his charge?</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And being borne French men, and subiects to the King, why should that naturall subiection be defaced by their shauing? Or who can suffer that a French man borne in France, of French parentage, should not be subiect to the King of France? and that in temporall things he should ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge another Soueraigne out of the Realme? and so be exempted from the commandement, vnto which God in his word bindeth all Christians?</p>
                  <p n="13">13. This also is clearer then the day, that Christian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth not depriue any man of his goods, nor of that law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full power which he had before he was conuerted to the faith. All men confesse that while King <hi>Clouis</hi> reigned, and
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:11462:292"/> was a Pagan, and all men generally were subiects vnto him, in all the countries contained within his kingdome. Then why should his conuersion to the faith depriue him of a part of his power, and exempt a part of his subiects (that is, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall persons) from being punishable by secular Iudges?</p>
                  <p n="14">14. And seeing that the soueraigne Prince ought to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>see as much as possible he may, how to preuent all disorders that happen in his Realme, how can he do it, if one part of those that liue in his Realme, and which possesse great wealth, are not subiects vnto him? Shall he without remedie therein taken, suffer certaine Clergie men to corrupt the good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of his subiects? or that they should haue secret intelligēce with strangers? or that they should cōspire treason against his life, or against his State? And if a Bishop being accessarie to the same crime, will not degrade a Clerke, shall he go vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished?</p>
                  <p n="15">15. The examples which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> produceth to defend this cause, sufficiently shew what we may iudge of these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions. For in that the Pope separateth marriages and exempteth children from the obedience of their parents, he inferreth that he may also exempt Clerkes from due obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their soueraigne Princes. That is to say, that the Pope may disanull the rule of Saint <hi>Mathew</hi> 19.6. which saith, <hi>What therefore God hath ioyned together, let no man put a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder:</hi> And exempt children from the commandement of God, which saith, <hi>Honour thy father and thy mother, &amp;c:</hi> And, <hi>Children obey your parents in all things, for that is well pleasing vnto the Lord,</hi> Coloss. 3.20.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. To say that Clergie men haue receiued these priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges from the liberalitie &amp; courtesies of Princes, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict the Pope &amp; <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> who maintaine that the Pope hath exempted Clerkes from this subiection, and that he may do it without asking counsell of any Prince. You must also know, that as a father cannot exempt his sonne from obeying the commandement of God, who will haue children to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour their fathers and mothers, by obeying them; so a Prince cannot exempt one part of his subiects (as long as they dwell

                  <p n="17">17. To say that Clerks ought voluntarily to subiect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to the lawes and gouernments of Magistrates, but if they do otherwise, that they may not be punished by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate, is as much as if a man should say, that lawes are no lawes to them. A law without punishments added thereunto, is onely a counsell. It is a commandement with a condition to do nothing, vnlesse we will our selues. Men ordinarily dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey lawes, notwithstanding prescribed punishments: how much more then will they disobey them when they feare not to be punished?</p>

                  <p>Some, (as the Cardinall <hi>du Perron</hi> in his oration made to
<pb n="548" facs="tcp:11462:298"/> the States in Paris vpon the 15. of Ianuarie, 1615) do not finde it good that Kings should be killed, but allow that the Pope should depose them: which is all one; for, to pronounce the sentence of deposing against a King, is as much as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne him to die, because (as they say) from the time of his deposing he is no more a lawfull King, but is held to be an v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surper. A meere vsurper of a kingdome may iustly be killed. <hi>In reos maiestatis &amp; publicos hostes, omnis homo miles est.</hi> So saith <hi>Tertullian.</hi> Take from a King the title of a lawfull King, and you take that from him which is the defence of his life, which may easily be taken from him by euery man that is carelesse of his owne life. Adde hereunto, that euery King which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, seeketh meanes to vphold his honour, to retaine the gouernment of his Countrie, and to defend himselfe against those that make any attempt against his Crowne. In this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke confusion, the King incurreth a thousand dangers, and exposeth his person to the dangers of warre. And there are not many soueraigne Princes found that haue suruiued their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, or that haue preserued their liues when they lost their Crownes. For a King is set in an high place, from whence he descendeth not by degrees, but falleth down headlong. And he that deposeth him goeth against all rules of humane wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, if he suffereth him to liue whom he hath deposed from the Empire, who without doubt will seeke to lay hold vpon that which he hath lost. Then whosoeuer he be that will not haue Kings killed, but wil haue them deposed, speakes as if he should say, Let vs not kill them, but let vs disarme them, that they may be killed. Let vs not take their liues from them, but let vs take the meanes from them to saue their liues. Let vs not kill him while he is a King, but let vs depose him; for by that meanes, he that shall kill him, shall not kill a King. These things are full of contradictions, and are very weakely set together: As the King of Great Brittaine hath excellently well shewed in his Declaration against the said Cardinall, whereby he did that to the said Prelate which the Pope doth to the new Cardinals the first day of their sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Consistorie;<note n="*" place="margin">Looke tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching this ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonie the 1. booke of Sacred Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.

<pb n="549" facs="tcp:11462:298"/> mouthes; but herein is the difference, that the Pope openeth their mouthes againe at the next Consistory following, but that great and wise King stopt the Cardinals mouth<note n="**" place="margin">Note that the said Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall liued three yeares and a halfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the King of great Brittains book</note> for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and in that matter put him to perpetuall silence. He did sufficiently condemne himselfe in his Oration, by saying, That for the same cause he was ready to suffer martyrdome; and yet it is a question not decided by the Scripture, nor by any Councels, and besides the Pope himselfe suffereth it to be accounted a Probleme, (that is, problematicall and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine:) from whence it followeth, that the martyrdome which a man suffereth for such a cause should be problematicall and vncertaine.</p>
                  <p>Now that which is most hard and intollerable in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is, that our aduersaries confesse, that the Pope may erre in his iudgement, and depose an innocent King, and<note n="*" place="margin">Cap. <hi>31.</hi> Quod autem dicis iniustam sententiam nō laedere eum in quem fertur, verū est quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do is in quem fertur eam hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militer tolerat &amp; obseruat, donec iniusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia vel potius nullitas mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festè se prodat.

It is <hi>Bellarmines</hi> speech in the 17. and 31. chapters of his book against <hi>Barkley.</hi> For he presupposeth that the new king that shall haue seised vpon the kingdome, will not put the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed king to death, but finding him to be innocent will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him againe, and reestablish him in his kingdome. What is this, but as much as if a man should spit in Kings faces, and leade them about like buffons, by adding euident laughter &amp; mockerie to iniustice?</p>
                  <p>To support this doctrine which trampleth vpon the maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie of God, in the persons of his annointed and his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, our aduersaries gather together a great number of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Scripture, as first, the Lord said to <hi>S. Peter, Feede my sheepe.</hi> Therefore the Pope may thrust Kings out of their thrones. And Saint <hi>Peter</hi> saying, <hi>Here are two swords;</hi> the Lord said, <hi>It is enough.</hi> And God said to <hi>Ieremie,</hi> 1. chap. 10. verse, <hi>I haue this day set thee ouer the nations and ouer the kingdomes.</hi> And Saint <hi>Paul</hi> said, 1. Cor. 2.15. <hi>The spirituall man iudgeth all things.</hi> This spirituall man is the Pope. And God said to Saint <hi>Peter. Whatsoeuer thou vnbindest on earth shall be vnbound in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</hi>
                     <pb n="550" facs="tcp:11462:299"/> Therefore the Pope may discharge subiects of their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection which they owe to their Prince. In the beginning of Genesis it is said, that <hi>In the beginning God made heauen and earth.</hi> It is <hi>in principio,</hi> and not <hi>in principijs,</hi> to shew that there is but one beginning, which is the Pope. These are of priuate vse, <hi>All things are giuen vnto me of my Father,</hi> Matth. 11.27. And <hi>All power is giuen vnto me in heauen and in earth,</hi> Matth. 28.18. And the diuels said, <hi>If thou wilt cast vs out, send vs into the swine that we may enter into them,</hi> Mark. 5.12. By this the Pope may dispose of temporall kingdomes. For it is said, Iohn 12.31. <hi>And I if I be lifted vp from the earth, will draw all men vnto me.</hi> Therefore the Pope being exalted, ought to draw all temporalties to himselfe. And see other places which are hard to be answered: Iesus Christ said to <hi>Peter, Put forth into the sea, and cast out the nets.</hi> And he saith, Luke 19.30. <hi>You shall find a colt tyed whereon yet neuer man sate, loose him, and bring him hither. Ergo,</hi> the Pope may dispose of all temporall things, and put Kings from their thrones.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>S. Paul 1. Cor 9.4. saith,</hi> Haue we not power to eate and to drinke?</note> With such places of Scripture the Popes and their Champions establish their Empire. Time is too precious to stand long to cōfute these childish proofes, which are not fit to be proposed but with the sword in hand. To propose these things is to refute them, and it is not cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible that any man will receiue or allow of these proofes, but he that willingly will be deceiued.</p>
                  <p>Cardinall <hi>du Perron</hi> was ashamed of such allegations, and would not produce them in his Oration, but he alledged o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which were no better then they.

Cardinall <hi>du Perron</hi> in his Oration seemeth to perswade, that this commandement was but by prouision and for a time. Which is a meanes to auoide all the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, and to dispense with them when we will. He should at least haue shewed how long that prouisionall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement continued, and at what time it began to binde mens consciences no more. This doth wrong the ancient Christians, and bereaueth their sufferings of the title of martyrdome, seeing that by his assertion they yeelded to the violence of Pagan Princes, (not to obey a necessarie and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine commandement of God,) but to a prouisionall rule, made for a time, till the Church (hauing recouered force by multitude of people) might shake off the yoke of their soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Prince. And thereby the Apostle is accused of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, for teaching Christians to faine and dissemble, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to be subiects to the Emperour, not thereby to obey God, but to accommodate themselues to the time,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:11462:300"/> and to yeeld to present necessitie. All this is confuted by the same Apostle in the same place, where he saith, That we must be subiect to the Prince, not onely because of wrath, that is, for feare to incurre his displeasure, but also for conscience sake.</p>
                  <p>Compare Iesus Christ paying tribute to <hi>Caesar,</hi> with the Pope which maketh <hi>Caesar</hi> pay tribute vnto him, and bindeth<note n="*" place="margin">This cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in the 1. booke of Sacred Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. Sect. 5. cap. 3.</note> him to lay a quantity of gold at his holinesse feete, that day when he setteth the Crowne vpon his head. Compare Iesus Christ counselling the Iewes to pay tribute to a Pagan Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, with the Pope that dispenseth with subiects touching their obedience to Christian Emperours and Kings: And Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, saying, that his kingdome is not of this world, with the Pope which hath erected a worldly Empire for himselfe. Compare Iesus Christ, who being on earth, had power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy and ouerthrow all Monarchs of the earth that were enemies to God, but would not do it; with the Pope, that hath no power to giue nor to take away kingdomes, but yet will do it, and attributeth a power vnto himselfe which he cannot execute:<note place="margin">Luke 12.14.</note> And Iesus Christ refusing to be arbitrator in a controuersie for an heritage betweene two particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, with the Pope, which intrudeth himselfe to be Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne and absolute Iudge of quarrels betweene Princes, and distributer of kingdomes.</p>
                  <p>Adde to this the rule of the word of God, which forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth periurie,<note place="margin">Exod. 20. Psal. 15.</note> and will haue vs to keepe our promise although it be vnto our owne hinderance. To the which commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is better to obey, then to the Pope, that boasteth that he can dispense with oathes made vnto God: wherein he doth manifestly exalt himselfe aboue God. For he that will dispense with a seruant for obeying of his maister, is greater then his maister. And hereby it will be found, that God shall not be serued nor obeyed, but in such manner as the Pope wil permit it, and that if by the Popes permission, any man be faithfull towards God, God is beholding to the Pope, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he prouideth him seruants, and such persons as are faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full vnto him. Therefore to obey God, those Officers who at
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:11462:300"/> the entrance into their offices tooke oathes of fidelity to their Kings, must be faithfull to the Pope, what thunderings &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements soeuer to rebellion shall happen to come from Rome to ouerthrow the Realme. If they reply and say, that by suffering a King that is an hereticke to reigne, Catholicke religion incurreth great danger: I answer, that oftentimes the Pope taketh on him to depose Kings that are of his owne reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Was it for heresie that <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. King of France was deposed? Was it for heresie that <hi>Iohn Albert</hi> King of Nauarre was deposed, and depriued of his kingdome by Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> 2? and so of <hi>Henrie</hi> the 4. of the Emperour <hi>Fredericke</hi> the 2. of <hi>Philip le Bel,</hi> of <hi>Iohn</hi> King of England, and diuers others. And although true religion should be persecuted by a king that is an hereticke, yet we must not remedie an euill by a sinne, nor defend pietie by disloyaltie. God hath no need of our vices to defend his cause. The preseruation of true religion is Gods cause, and his worke, which he will not abandon nor forsake. When humane meanes seeme to faile and decay, he watcheth and taketh care for the preseruation of his Church: and if he will afflict it, we must humble our selues, and when he will deliuer it from danger, we need not to bring periurie and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to aide him, as if he had no other meanes to do it.</p>
                  <p>This also passeth all absurditie, to imagine, that Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and the Bishop of Rome after him, had power (as they say) to depose the Emperor <hi>Nero</hi> or <hi>Domitian.</hi> Without doubt those Emperours that knew not that there was a Christian Bishop in Rome (so poore and miserable were the said Bishops) are excusable for not acknowledging and honouring those Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops as their superiours in temporall things, and who had power to thrust them out of their Empires.</p>
                  <p>But why did not those Bishops aduertise and shew the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of the authoritie which they had ouer Empires, that so the Emperours might not pretend cause of ignorance? Why did not the Bishop of Rome depose those Emperours when they violently persecuted the Church? Was it because they would vse courtesie and clemencie vnto those poore Emperours? But that clemencie had bene crueltie towards
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:11462:301"/> the Church. Was it because they feared the power of those Emperours? So it may be said, that the obedience which they yeelded to their soueraigne Prince, was done by dissimulation and by force. Adde hereunto that <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the 37. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Apologie, and <hi>Cyprian</hi> against <hi>Demetrius,</hi> say, that in their times euery place was ful of Christians that were able to defend themselues, and that they held the greatest part of the Empire of Rome, and yet did not defend themselues a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the violence of those Emperours. In the time of the Emperour <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostata, three parts of the Empire were Christians, and his armies were composed of Christians, and yet the Bishop of Rome did not thinke vpon deposing him from the Empire. The same Bishop also did not pronounce sentence of deposition against the Kings of the Gothes that were Arrians, reigning in Spaine; nor against the Kings of the Vandals that were Arrians, reigning in Africa; although they were farre distant from Rome, and that the Bishop of Rome had no cause to feare their forces.</p>
                  <p>Who will beleeue that Iesus Christ gaue Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and his successors a charge for so many yeares together, without power to execute it? and that he gaue them a sword to hang vp a thousand yeares together against the wall, and neuer to be drawne out but of late yeares? Is it credible, that the Popes began first to know the nature of their charge, then when their Sea or seate fell into all maner of vices, as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test flatterers of the Pope confesse and acknowledge? Besides, it is euident and most manifestly knowne by experience, that the Pope neuer began to employ that power, but for his owne profit: and thereby increased in riches and greatnesse; neuer giuing any absolution to a Prince, but vpon gainfull conditions for the Pope, as he did to <hi>Henrie</hi> the second, and <hi>Iohn,</hi> Kings of England. But when his thunderbolts cānot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile, and that the excommunicated King getteth the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then his Holinesse with paternall compassion receiueth him into his fauour, and bestoweth all maner of spirituall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictions vpon him. As Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 5. in the Exrraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant <hi>Meruit</hi> did, where he commendeth and exalteth the pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:11462:301"/> of <hi>Philip</hi> the Faire, and of his people, notwithstanding the hard vsage shewed vnto him by <hi>Boniface</hi> the eight his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor.</p>
                  <p>It is no lesse incredible, that if a Pagan Prince becometh a Christian (as <hi>Clowis</hi> King of France did) he should haue lesse kingly authoritie then when he was a Pagan; and that his conuersion to the faith, should be a diminishing of his power Yet that is the Popes and the Iesuites opinion. For it is out of doubt, that <hi>Clowis</hi> being a Pagan, did not acknowledge the Bishop of Rome for his superiour, or that there was any Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop either within or without his kingdome that could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose him of his Crowne. And if the Pope may change and depose Christian Kings, it followeth that <hi>Clowis</hi> Crowne vpon the day of his conuersion lost the splendor and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne dependance thereof, and began to be in the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of another, and that then he began to acknowledge a Superiour in temporall things: which is, to be a Soueraigne no more. By this doctrine it will be hard to perswade a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan Prince to become a Christian.</p>
                  <p>But what reason is there that Kings should be more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the Pope, then their subiects are? and that Kings should be hardlier dealt withall then particular persons? For if a subiect of France shall erre in the faith, or commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterie, or vse his seruants tyrannously, the Pope neuer to this day durst vndertake to driue him from his house, or to depriue him of his office; then why should a King falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the like faults be hardlier dealt withall? Why should the Pope haue more power ouer him, then ouer particular men? depriuing him of his Crowne, and by consequence of his life? Is it because the Pope thinketh that our Kings haue lesse spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and lesse courage then particular persons? Or rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Pope abusing Kings in that maner, raiseth himselfe to soueraigne greatnesse, and becometh thereby distributer of Empires and kingdomes?</p>
                  <p>We haue somewhat largely spoken of this subiect, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery man may see whether <hi>M. Arnoux</hi> hath reason to speake of vs as of men that repugne all humane order, and are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:11462:302"/> of al subiection. Our Confession protesteth the contrary, and experience iustifieth vs. We neuer attempted any thing against the liues of our Kings. <hi>Iaques Clement, Iohn Chastel, Rauaillac, Garnet, Oldcorne,</hi> and such monsters, and all those who hauing sought to kill the King, and fained madnesse to saue themselues, were not of our religion: but the most part of them were Iesuites, or Iesuites disciples. We neuer spake of deposing our Kings, neither beleeue that any man liuing in the world can depose a King, or dispense with his subiects touching their oathes of fidelitie. And they that know the truth, will acknowledge, that the reason which hath moued the Pope and the Clergie to persecute vs with fire and sword, hath not bene so much because we do not beleeue Transsub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation, nor the sacrifice of the Masse, nor inuocation of Saints, but because (if we might be beleeued) our Kings Crowne should no more depend vpon the Pope. And causes of Benefices and of matrimonie should no more be called to Rome, the Realme should be no more tributarie, vnder pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Annates, Dates, Dispensations, and Absolutions. And French men should runne no more to Rome for pardons; whereby his Holinesse profits would much diminish. Which if we would not meddle withall, he would by speciall priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge suffer and permit vs to beleeue the Gospell.</p>

<pb n="557" facs="tcp:11462:302"/> of the reuerend father <hi>Binet</hi> the Iesuite, that said to <hi>M.

                  <p>The reasons which they alledge for this opinion, are, that the first King that was in the world, that is <hi>Nimrod,</hi>
                     <note n="***" place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.</note> made himselfe King by force, and not by the ordinance of God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the greatest part of Empires and kingdomes that euer were, were erected by conquest, one nation hauing ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come another, or one Prince moued by ambition, hauing moued an vniust quarrel against his neighbour Prince. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Emperours and Kings are established by humane meanes, whether they attaine to the Crowne by hereditarie succession, or by election: seeing there is neither any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie reuelation, nor rule in the word of God which bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth a nation rather to follow hereditarie succession then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Fourthly, that there is no expresse commandement set downe by God to obey <hi>Henrie</hi> or <hi>Lewis,</hi> or to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge this or that man more then another to be King. Fiftly, that for these considerations, the Apostle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> calleth the obedience to Kings an humane order, saying, <hi>Submit your selues to euery ordinance of man, for the Lords sake, whether it be to the King as supreme, or vnto Gouernours, &amp;c.</hi> 1. Pet. 2.13.</p>
                  <p>We on the contrary maintaine, that obedience due to Kings and Magistrates proceedeth from the diuine Law, &amp; is groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vpon the ordinance of God. To that end all the places of Scripture hereafter set down do serue, to shew that God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth obedience to Kings and Soueraigne powers, as to those whom he hath established, whom no man may resist without resisting God. <hi>There is no power but of God, the powers that be are ordained of God, whosoeuer therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God.</hi> Rom. 13.1.2. And verse 5. <hi>Wherfore ye must needs be subiect, not onely for wrath, but also for conscience sake.</hi> And S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the same place which they obiect against vs, will haue vs to yeeld obedience to Kings <hi>for the Lords sake.</hi> And although <hi>Nabuchadnezzar</hi> was an vngodly King and a scourge vsed by God to destroy nations, neuerthelesse God speaketh thus vnto him by his Prophet <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the 2. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:11462:303"/> 37. verse, saying: <hi>Thou ô King art a King of Kings, for the God of heauen hath giuen thee a kingdome, power, and strength, and glory. Moses</hi> the first Prince and Law-giuer in Israel, was established by the ordinance of God, &amp; <hi>Ioshua</hi> after him. Nū. 27.18. <hi>Saul</hi> first King of Israel,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 10.1. and 16.13.</note> and <hi>Dauid</hi> his successor were annointed by <hi>Samuel,</hi> and consecrated to be Kings according to Gods ordinance. And 2. Kings 9.1.2. God sent a Prophet to <hi>Iehu</hi> to annoint him King of Israel. <hi>He looseth the bonds of Kings, and girdeth their loynes with a girdle,</hi> Iob 12.18. <hi>But God is the Iudge, he putteth downe one, and setteth vp another,</hi> Psal. 75.7. <hi>He raiseth the poore out of the dust, and lifteth the needie out of the dunghill, that he may set him with Princes.</hi> Psal. 113.7.8. And if the prouidence of God extendeth it selfe so farre as to feede birds, and giueth food to the beasts and to the yong ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens which cry vnto him, Psal. 147.9. so farre as that he num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breth all our haires, so that not one falleth to the ground with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his prouidence; who will beleeue that when a man is to be placed aboue others, and to be made head and ruler of so many millions of people, the counsell and prouidence of God doth not therein rule, or that he suffereth things to be done by chance or aduenture?</p>
                  <p>The reasons which they alledge against so euident a truth, halt, and flie but with one wing.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <note place="margin">An answer to the 5. obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our aduersaries.</note>1. They say, that <hi>Nimrod</hi> the first King in the world attained thereunto by force. But it is false, that before <hi>Nimrod</hi> there was no Soueraigne Prince in the world. Before <hi>Nimrod</hi> the fathers and heads of families were Kings, Priests, and soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne Princes of their families. For after the floud men liued 5. or 6. hundred yeares. Then it was an easie matter for a man to see 50. yea an 100. thousand persons of his posteritie, ouer whom he exercised paternall power, and by consequence so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne power: then when there was no other forme of a Realme vpon the earth; to which children, their seruants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing added, one familie alone made a great commonwealth. Likewise in <hi>Abrahams</hi> time, whē mans life was much shorte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, we reade that <hi>Abraham</hi> was by the Hethites called a Prince of God, that is, an excellent Prince. Gen. 23.6. And
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:11462:303"/> that out of his familie he tooke 318. souldiers to go to warre therewith. If you adde his seruants and such seruants as were vnfit for the warre, you must confesse that although he had no children, his familie would haue peopled a whole towne.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They also obiect, that the greatest part of Empires and kingdomes began by conquest, and by force of armes, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not by the ordinance of God; and that if the conqueror inuaded another mans territories by the ordinance of God, the inhabitants of that countrie had offended God in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselues. Whereunto I say, that those whose countries a strange Prince seeketh to inuade, do well to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. And that if in that defensiue warre the vsurper chance to be slaine, he is iustly punished. But if he getteth the vpper hand, if the race of the ancient possessors of the same country be cleane extinguished, if the States of the country assembled together do agree vpon a new forme of gouernment, and if all the officers throughout the countrie haue taken their oathes of fidelitie to the new King: then we must beleeue that God hath established such a Prince in that kingdome. Then I say, that the people ought to yeeld to the will of God, who for the sinnes of Kings and of their people transporteth king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and disposeth of the issues of battels at his will and pleasure.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is to no purpose to say, that Princes enter into king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, either by hereditary succession, or by election, which are ordinary meanes by custome, and not by the ordinance of God. For the question is not, by what meanes a Prince at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to his kingdome, but whether by the ordinance of God we ought to obey him after he is established therein. And our aduersaries will haue the power of Popes to proceed from the ordinance of God, although they enter into the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacie by election, by indirect courses, by artificiall deuices, and by worse meanes then humane wayes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If there be no commandement in the word of God to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey <hi>Henry</hi> or <hi>Lewis,</hi> it sufficeth that there is a commandement to obey the King, and a commandement to keepe our oathes of fidelity made to the King, and by consequence to
<pb n="560" facs="tcp:11462:304"/> be faithfull to that King to whom we sweare obedience and loyaltie. Neither is there a commandement of God to be found that bindes vs to obey <hi>Clement</hi> or <hi>Boniface</hi> as Popes, to whom neuerthelesse our aduersaries esteeme themselues to be subiect by the Law of God. If this consideration might take place, it would follow that no man in the world is bound by diuine ordinance to feare God, or to beleeue in Iesus Christ, because the Scripture doth not particularly ordaine that <hi>Thibault, Anthony,</hi> or <hi>William,</hi> should feare God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in Iesus Christ. If sufficeth that the word of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth generall rules, which bind particular persons without naming them.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is true that S. <hi>Peter</hi> in the place before alledged, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the obediēce that men owe vnto Kings, an humane order, either because Kings command diuers things which of their owne natures are not deriued from the diuine Law, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding of knocking by night, or to go by night without a candle; or because they attaine to that power by certaine hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane meanes, induced by custome: which hinders not but that their power is grounded vpō the word of God after they are once established. For in this question our difference is not touching the meanes whereby a Prince attaineth to a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but what obedience is due vnto him after he hath at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained thereunto. Therefore after S. <hi>Peter</hi> had called that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an humane order, he commandeth vs to subiect our selues thereunto <hi>for Gods sake:</hi> and so to obey his commandement.</p>
                  <p>Whosoeuer buildeth the authority of Kings vpon mens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, and not vpon the ordinance of God, cutteth off three parts of their authority, and bereaueth them of that which assureth their liues and their Crownes more then the guards of their bodies, or puissant armies, which put terror in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to subiects hearts, in stead of framing them to obedience. Then the fidelity of subiects will be firme and sure, when it shall be incorporated into pietie, and esteemed to be a part of religion, and of the seruice which men owe vnto God.</p>
